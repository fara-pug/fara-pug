# Intro

I love the depth and variety in this game. The encounters can be short and
sweet, or long and trecherous. The world has beauty and there is heaps of
creativity in the maps and their many variations.  The exploration and combat
systems are challenging and yet you almost never feel as if the game is out to
get you.

> FARA is a Nethack for the new millenium.
> Its brilliant and innovative like a rogue done right!
>   &#x2013; Pug.

FARA is an open world sandbox that never rushes you to advance, while seeming to
adapt to your powers to keep even low difficulty zones full of surprises. You
will enjoy the turn-based combat, the ability to explore dangerous places with
capable and fearless mercenaries to help. There are 52 classes with unique
traits that simply make sense. The RPG steretypes and classes you know will 
begin to look primitive as you learn to play different classes and explore
FARA's many mysteries.

If you don't know what I'm talking about, visit [FARA's Homepage](https://brianiscreative.itch.io/fara) and take a look
at these [Game-play videos](https://www.startpage.com/sp/search?query=FARA+Rougelike+youtube&cat=video).

## Notes

This page serves as a repository for my notes about the game. 

During my first play-session some years ago I hit a wall and swore to myself
that I would beat this thing one day. And I finally have.

It was not a big, triumphant, clever win. Definitely not! I played, what looked
to me like the most survivable class, the [Gatekeeper](#orgd3aaa3a) as defensively as I could
and for 150 days stuck my head into dangerous places, learning and exploring as
I went - and now that my understanding has grown, my notes and my approach to
them is evolving too.

Winning, for me meant 'Completing the Astral Key'. It also marks the beginning
of what puts my Character into the 'Age of Steel', sees me Mining and Fishing
more, and at last! has me manage inventory and items the way the Elders intended.

Pug's Notes below don't reflect all I've learned by reaching my milestone yet,
but they are not harmful if you're just starting out.

## Finding

> One day these notes will be well styled and modern looking.
> That day has not yet come.

The note are a single page so they can be searched with ease and confidence.
Use **Ctrl-F** in your browser to look for things, then press **Backspace** to return
where you started. 

As these notes change 'rolling unannounced updates' appear on the [web-page
hosted at github](https://fara-pug.github.io/fara-pug/). The HTML version I link to has a style-sheet optimized for
readability. I keep meaning to use that for proof-reading.

A second, alway in sync version uses a [crisper more technical style](https://github.com/fara-pug/fara-pug/blob/main/index.md) that makes
the notes and tables look quite nice also.

The writing and production of these docs takes place in Emacs/org-mode since
that's what I know and spend a lot of time with IRL. As every emacs user wants
to spread the gospel, I invite you to take a look at [some org-mode videos](https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=emacs+org+mode+outline+youtube).
Long story short, if/when you try org-mode you'll want to use the [source-document](https://github.com/fara-pug/fara-pug).

Since my schedule does not allow me to play all that often, find out about
updates to the notes by subscribing to <https://github.com/fara-pug.atom> via an
rss-feed reader. I like the [Feedbro Reader](https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=Feedbro+Reader) since it works well in almost any
browser. Set the update interval to weekly to catch up with changes and 
improvements to these notes. Set "maximum items to keep" to 1.

Make sure you also subscribe to Brianiscreative's [FARA RSS feed](https://brianiscreative.itch.io/fara/devlog.rss). If you haven't,
do it now!

I will see any DM's you send me on Discord, when I'm not busy elsewhere since
Discord doesn't get to email me. To get my attention though, make an account on
Github and post a comment to trigger an email that way. Its no bother at all!
Email will reach me most weeks.

-   Any Weapon can be worn as an accessory for some powerful stat boosts!
-   Once you've looted you'll want a [Bag](#org6a8d497) to carry things home in **/stealth** mode.


<a id="org2216f3f"></a>

## Armor

Mishaal's research on the stat bonuses of armor is awesome!

-   We still need that for Weapons!

All listed bonuses are 1.

-   Each level of refinement adds an additional bonus point to the listed stat!
-   Ignore anything without a bonus
-   Upgrade breastplates which give a bonus and a malus twice to get a bonus in two stats!
-   Jumpsuits truly start with 2 boni
-   Ignore accessories because you want to have a bag or weapon in that slot.
    -   or the bonus of quiver/bandolier on combat turns out to be real and valuable to you.

-   Yes, Boots made from soft materials provide a bonus to Finesse while those
    made from hard materials do not.

### Blights

Instead of simply dying and staring at your screen dumbfoundedly, the force
which brought you into the game supports you again by giving you get a chance to
come back to solve the real mysteries of FARA.

That's to say, you somehow come back to life, just a little shaken and just a
little bit worse. When you come back, you might suffer or notice one of these
effects (A lot of people died researching this; A moment of silence please!):

-   Stronger Enemies
-   Increased Encounter Rate
-   Increased Damage Taken
-   Reduced Damage Dealt
-   Increased Stamina Use
-   Reduced Food Effects
-   Reduced Inventory Capacity (-5 per blight)
-   Reduced Strength
-   Reduced Finesse
-   Reduced Resilienc
-   Reduced Insight
-   Reduced Charm

Each of these Blights decreases your chances of resurrecting again. Exactly what
that means is unclear.. except that it will prevent you from cultivating your follies.

Feedback:

-   I got 4 Blights once. I never got more than 4, though this doesn't necessarily
    mean its impossible. It would require a lot of testing to be sure.
-   Taking the first blight is a guaranteed success I think? I never had it fail,
    and it does make sense.
-   Do not attack Relica's elder. He will end your run, and no amount of blights
    will ever save you from his unending wrath.
-   I think you might have an increased chance of levelling up a blight instead of
    getting a new one if you already have it.

My testing was not extensive, I only kept going until I was pretty sure I'd seen
all the blights. tbh 1, 2, and 4 would require some very rigorous testing to be
sure.

### Character Stats

-   see /define for great upto-date info
-   includes info from discord and <https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Character_Stats>
-   If you have high health and high resilience then you are probably good at tanking
-   Moods affect your stats positively as well as negatively.
-   Being sleepy or well rested affects your stats as well
-   "c" shows your stats of the moment, moods, tiredness & equipment included.

1.  Details

    1.  Strength
    
        -   Increases damage dealt with melee weaponry
        -   Increases damage dealt through unarmed strikes
        -   Decreases stamina spent pushing large objects.
        -   Increases your chances of succeeding at a **/grab**
        
        STR weapons should do the most damage per hit in close quarters.
        (Weapon damage is not depended on weapon size, but refinement and materials)
    
    2.  Finesse
    
        -   Increases damage dealt with range weaponry
        -   Increases chance to disarm traps,
        -   Increases stealth ability
        -   Increases your **/dash** distance and (maybe?) decreases its stamina cost
        -   Decreases reload time of ranged weapons
        -   Decreases stamina used by jumping and stealth.
        
        Makes you good at hiding, attacking from range, with daggers and  other finesse weaponry
    
    3.  Resilience
    
        -   Reduces physical damage taken,
        -   Reduces duration of negative effects,
        -   Increases stamina regeneration rate.
        -   Warhammer heavies do more damage based on RES
    
    4.  Insight
    
        Makes you good with Spells, Staves, Focuses, Wands and Scepters.
        
        -   Increases the damage of spells,
        -   Increases your search ability,
        -   Decreases the stamina cost of spells.
    
    5.  Charm
    
        -   Increases the duration of buffs/positive effects
        -   Increases odds of favorable outcomes (such as?)
        -   Does it Decreases the duration of mali/negative effects??
        
        Your charm doesn't increase your ability to lead a party and it does
        not affect your party's maximum size. (max party size may be class dependent)
        
        Charm does make it easier to form good relationships with NPCs, meaning that
        with more charm **/joke**, **/gossip**, etc. will be better received and they
        will think you more of a friend for doing quests for them.
        
        Unsure how that matters. Will they remember your birthday? Give more loot?
        
        More important.. If charm is luck and insight searching, then why isn't everyone
        talking about making shovels and fishing-rods from crystal or even obsidian?
        I think some testing is in order.. Can it be that people don't like setting up
        house on the beach? Whats going on there..

2.  Health Brackets

    -   Healthy = full health
    -   Wounded = Starts at ~75%
    -   Injured = Starts at ~50%
    -   Dying = Starts at ~25%

3.  Damage reduction

    Resilience is tied to Damage reduction (DR)
    
    -   Shield give DR, at the cost of jumping costing more stamina
    -   Multiple sources of DR stack
    -   Fishmonger gets a bunch of DR by being drunk

4.  Notes

    Stats are improved by wearing or holding gear with stat alterations
    affixed. Most of these affixes are determined by the Crafting Materials that the
    item is made out of, but some can come from the item itself, or tools that
    further enhance items.
    
    We need a table of Item characteristics!
    
    -   perhaps someone with godlike stats would post a savegame to look at for the
        details in the recipes they've collected somewhere?
    -   perhaps the brain will give us a button to export such a list for things known
        inside a game!


<a id="org34ea320"></a>

### Key fragments

-   One for every 10 unknown monsters you inspect.
-   It is possible to win just by inspecting monsters.
    -   Winning isn't the end.
    -   I think its after you do that the real game starts.
-   One for reaching max renown with a faction.
-   Rarely and randomly, from fishing or digging.
-   At the end of Dungeons.
-   By ending Nobles, even Village Elders.
-   Check your **/spells** spell-list for emergency and post-win uses.

1.  Meta

    I read that each new shard contibutes more points to your score than the previous one.
    
    Thus if you aim to level up your stats by putting shards into them you should do
    it with the 9th shard so that you collect the most unlock points for doing that.
    
    Go to relica and spend an IRL day farming nothing but 'find monster' quests and
    tell me how far you get and how long it takes.
    
    1.  crazy math
    
        If you're strong enough to move to another settlement, can you turn your naked
        self into a being with godlike stats while unlocking all the classes playing the
        meta-game of animal researcher?
        
        there are 5 primary stats. lets say they average '10 of 20'. you'd need 50 9th
        shards to become a god. that's 500 new animal species discovered, and maybe 500
        days spent in game.
        
        hmm, lol, i wonder how long brute-forcing 10 find-animal quests would take and
        if i could resist the urge to just complete the key to be done with the game.
        
        maybe i should complete the key first and see what revelations that brings.
        decisions. decisions. /end crazy math


<a id="org1b70bf3"></a>

### Resting

I read that you can rest on mats. that's not true.

You need/want

-   a whatever bed, unsure that materials provide boni to sleep
-   to be within the glow of a brazier (what else works?)
-   to be behind any kind of **closed** door.

Now&#x2026; if you find a mattress, blanket or a pillow count yourself lucky!

Pillows need feathers.. and the only way i can imagine getting any feathers is
from a bird joining battle, angered by my taking their nest of of their tree.

-   Castles, Fortresses, Labyrinths, Random and even delapidated ruins all count
    as safe indoor sleeping places even if undiscovered enemies remain.

-   Got woken up after building a shack on a map with an undiscovered species I
    was looking for. Once. So far I've never been attacked at night even sleeping
    in ruins.

Its a good idea to keep two wooden log in your inventory so you don't have to
scrounge for one in the middle of the night while traveling!

You want to make a shelter and a install a door before you sleep, because
[thievery](#orge737c30) is a thing and can become a real problem. /me learns to tremble at the
thought of having to cross deserts at night without 2 logs. one for a shelter,
one for a door.


<a id="orgfc9d8e3"></a>

### Titles

You obtain these by:

-   Completing a settlement
-   Ranking up in a faction
-   Conquering monster dens
-   Dungeons?
-   Faction-specific quests

Would be nice to have a list for those striving to become an Über-player!

example: "Ÿou, Director of .."

-   many/some/several, not-all titles come with a key-fragment!


<a id="org52f0c20"></a>

### Party

I may be dreaming but were there no saddle-bags in that old version? Can my pet
and merc help me carry things? So much to determine yet. I should probably look
into simply equipping my new merc first.


<a id="orgb71dcd3"></a>

## Buildings

This section is about the unlockable building you can find in every settlement.
Completing all of them makes you a Settlement Hero, which is a Title that can
be useful when you want to talk to or hire NPC's for your travels.

The costs were transcribed from Relica by Pug.

Don't compromise on gear to invest in buildings,
You only **need** the Warehouse at the start.


<a id="org960b85e"></a>

### Warehouse

"Gives access to a thing that helps you move to other settlements."

1.  Cost

    -   2 medals
    -   20 wooden planks
    -   10 ropes

2.  Benefits

    -   Crucible that gives shared access to your stash of buffs, situational uniques,
        and supplies for expanding elsewhere.
    
    -   6 Storage bins, probably best when only used in Relica, that let you get rid of
        things you dont want to see but dont want to loose. See [4.5](#orgc710cd0)


<a id="org0c1b693"></a>

### Stables

How!?@?#

1.  Cost

    -   2 medals
    -   10 copper ingots
    -   5 wooden buckets (got recipe after opening refinery)

2.  Benefit

    Aha's from looking at my first Stables.
    Yours will be similar I'd think. So.. Oh!
    
    -   its a farm with spice and tree plots! 
        -   a garlic and a fennel plot
        -   a lemon and a maple tree plot

    -   5 wooden stools
    -   5 glass mugs

2.  Benefit

    -   A [Gambler](#org4b207d2) that gives you 25% odds of scoring..
        -   blue prints and rare materials
    -   A High level merc that wont talk to you until a title or two
    -   A Well skilled merc that can hold his own
    -   A Damsel in distress NPC i escorted elsewhere
    
    Have to check up on the patrons there again.
    If all that got me was a gambling chance at BPs, fine!


<a id="org4c949f1"></a>

### Obelisk

1.  Cost

    -   2 medals
    -   10 stones
    -   25 runic shards

2.  Benefit

    The same damn obelisk you keep finding in the wilderness, but with a researcher
    that offer runes for sale and who keeps the rock polished.
    
    -   Infinite uses for the same price you'd pay at single use obelisks found in the wilderness.
    
    -   Single level upgrade obtained by beating the Bosses at Ruins become less
        attractice once you have this, but its hard to beat 'free and scary'.

3.  Staff

    The Arcane Researcher employed here, psychic and creative as he appears to be
    gives you following 5 options to obtain a rune of "Something" from him for a
    number of shards. These somethings could be:

    <td class="org-left"><- But look at that!</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
    The first interaction I had with him was to buy something unknown of course. And
    what I got wasn't a random thing, but a rune I had never seen before! Trying again
    of course I got a very highly rated rune, the rune of spears. But I already had one
    of thos in inventory. 
    
    So I don't know. Did his psychic let him give me one kind of rune that I had never had
    before then picking something destructive randomly? I'll have to solicit and wait for
    feedback to get clear on that, or try it again in the next game. Respect!

    After, hmm, a little grinding, I got a bucket recipe allowing me to complete the
    stables. That was nice. I also got a nice everburning? lantern that helps to
    attract even more encounters at night
    
    Here's a log of what he did for me in the beginning:
    
    -   each item cost 1 Medal
    -   all but the first item were of (Refined) Quality.

    I might have missed an item there, but suddenly he asked for a crafted input,
    turning **bone nunchucks > swordchucks**.
    
    After he wanted the nunchucks he started asking for wooden blocks. Perhaps we're
    coming close to a new materials tier after 12..13 runs.. Verry nice, very
    grindy, very medal-expensive!
    
    **3 wooden blocks > wooden anvil**
    
    Afterwards he wanted bones again..
    
    Anyway, now i can consult the [Materials Tables](#org129a58a) and better versions
    of his more sensible items. neat!
    
    -   Keeping these prototypes makes sense to me right now.
    
    -   Signs.. used to be terribly important in the old version i played. Perhaps
        they have a discoverable function..
    
    -   I guess I have to keep feeding him till he comes up with a pickaxe for mining!

## Classes

You can break down these classes into three primary approaches at the start of
the game.  FARA is very classic in this way and you can think about the
approaches as being Melee/Strength, Rogue/Finesse and Magic/Insight based at the
start of the game.

But you needn't get locked in, feel limited by this. All your stats will improve
and everyone has the potential to reach GODLIKE in all the stats &#x2013; by which
point you'll be able be effective in at least two, if not all three of these
approaches.

            -   Fishmonger's really grindy if you want to do it
            -   Get a whole lot of dowels
            -   Waypoint your spawn area
            -   Once you've got a huge amount of dowels
            -   Get a crystal/iron/bronze fishing rod
            -   Any uncommon tier fishing rod
            -   Crafted with wooden blocks
            -   Used for tools
            -   So you've got your huge pile of dowels
            -   (~100)
            -   wow
            -   And your uncommon fishing rod
            -   Preferably iron, since it's easiest
            -   (find a fortress and salvage the doors)
            -   (You need to craft a wooden fishing rod to unlock other recipes)
            -   Now, go back to spawn with the lake
            -   And fish until the rod's ruined
            -   With the Fishmonger trait, you should have enough runes to salvage into runic shards and make a repair kit with your dowels + shards
            -   Use the repair kit to repair the rod
            -   Repeat that process
            -   passing down anchient knowlage
            -   You should slowly get enough extra runic shards to craft refined tools (25 shards)
            -   Use them on the fishing rod
            -   Continue fishing until the rod is [ruined] and repairing the rod by salvaging the runes
            -   Make it artisan (50 shards)
            -   Then start making your other equipment refined
            -   And then artisan
            -   secret knowlage here wow
            -   You should also get a whole bunch of runes that are useful for you
            -   Get a rune of curses and a rune of intoxication
            -   And set them aside when you get them
            -   Once you've got both, drop them in the same place and use /makespell or /ms
            -   You will now have an arcane curse of intoxication
            -   Fishmonger takes significantly reduced damage while intoxicated, so you can /selfcast 3 to give yourself an arcane curse of intoxication
            -   The reason the element chosen is arcane is because very few entities use the arcane element
            -   And curse spells increase damage taken from an element
            -   The intoxication rune has to be on an attacking spell, since it's a negative effect
            -   Basically You curse yourself with intoxication + increased arcane damage taken
            -   i knew thats an exploit. i just thought i could use some vodka or smth :slight<sub>smile</sub>:
            -   But nothing really uses the arcane element so you only really get intoxication
            -   Yes, you can use vodka and all other alcohol
            -   so in summery fish fish fish curse fish fish fish and get POWA
            -   Fishmonger has 2 spell slots, so you can make a second spell too
            -   the intox debuff gives you +RES and +CHA
            -   But once you have a bunch of booze and a tower shield then you are practically unkillable
    
    4.  GATEKEEPER
    
        Besiegement - Gatekeepers regenerate health after successfully blocking attacks
        with a shield, do not degrade their armor and shields with use, and have a
        higher than usual chance to block enemies attempting to flee.

        1.  [Tips from the Wiki](https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Class_Tips)
        
            Gatekeeper's are very good at protecting allies, making them very good at escort quests. Their Protect ability allows them to half all incoming damage dealt to an ally, at the cost of around 1/3 of your stamina. They automatically deflect projectiles aimed toward them, and their armor takes less durability damage from combat and wear-and-tear alike.
            
            Some good ways to effectively use Gatekeeper are:
            
            -   Try and always keep a Silencing spell ready. Silencing enemies prevents them from spellcasting anything that hinders your ability to use Protect or any other spells.
            -   Gatekeepers have Average Strength and Finesse at the start, so its up to you whether you want to use ranged or melee weapons.
            -   Its also a good idea to keep meals/mixtures/dishes with either Strength or Finesse buffs on hand for temporary buffs.
            -   Shields are very useful to Gatekeepers. With full armor and a shield that has Average or higher damage reduction, there is a chance that the Gatekeeper will be able to take about 2-3 hits without dealing direct damage to your Health.
    
    5.  RAGAMUFFIN
    
        Sticky Fingers - Ragamuffins have an increased chance to steal successfully and

        1.  Botanist
        
            <https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Botanist>
            
            Botanist is one of the interesting classes you can use in Fara, their unique
            ability "Familiar Phytology" has a huge potential if you know how to use it
            efficiently. First of all let's see what the ability is about.
            
            Familiar Phytology - Botanists have access to the Enrich Plant skill, which
            allows them to turn any plant into allied Plant baby. Feeding Plant Babies by
            hand will cause them to grow more powerful, and the chosen food will determine
            what abilities/skills they have. Casting Enrich Plant while already having a
            plant familiar will kill the older familiar.
            
            Basically after using the "Enrich Plant" skill of the botanist on trees or
            bushes will turn them into an ally plant baby. An allied plant has a total of 4
            stages.
            
            -   Baby, Kid, Beast, Behemoth
            
            As you may have read earlier plant allies can be evolved by being hand fed
            anything that is edible. You will need a total of 55 food to max out the
            evolution process of your plant, but always remember to think about on what the
            55th food will be since that will determine what type of behemoth you will get!
            Other than being being able to get them from your first day in your run, you can
            make new ones that will be stronger the farther you are from Relica! So far I
            have only tapped into Veteran behemoths but I think there are far more stronger
            variants the farther we go, for now I will show the stats of an amateur ones
            below.
            
            Number of how many you have to feed before evolving along with stats and skills

            This may help you in the early run if you can get them into a behemoth fast
            since you may also get a mercenary as another companion with your first battle
            chest reward when you get to Relica. The stats will go up as you make plant
            allies when you are farther Relica, and also another good thing is it will not
            cost you anything other than some few seeds and berries here and there.

            This class excels in melee combat due to Its Good Resilience and Above Average
            Strength/Health, which allows this class to take lots of damage while dealing
            good damage up close. 'Know Thy Foe' also Silences enemies, preventing them from
            spellcasting. Classes that rely on spells are at a huge disadvantage against
            this class.
            
            Some good ways to effectively use Demon Slayer are:
            
            -   Always keep spells that give you Rage, Fortification, and/or Rejuvenation, on
                you. These spells will come in handy if you cast them before you engage an
                enemy.
            -   Hearty and Robust Meals/Mixtures/Dishes are good for temporary buffs before
                you fight something or explore dungeons.
            -   Try to keep most, if not all, battles up close. You can choose to raise
                Finesse of you like, but keep battles up close at the beginning of your game.

        1.  [Tips from the Wiki](https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Class_Tips)
        
            Reaper is a very complex class to play. With low health and strength, its hard
            to get kills without learning spells. Some of the most important runes you will
            need are:
            
            -   Rejuvenation, Fortification, Blinding, Silencing
            
            Another drawback is its ability 'Deathsense', which buffs strength and insight
            when a nearby entity is close to dying. With low strength to start out with,
            getting close and trying to melee is very hard, and can kill you nearly every
            time without the proper equipment. Having at least one healing spell is crucial
            to playing this class, as you will find out your health gets drained in a matter
            of a couple rounds.

        1.  [Tips from the Wiki](https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Class_Tips)
        
            Kensai's are good at quick damage dealing. Their 'Samurai Showdown' ability has
            a wide variety of uses, including the ability to practically teleport to an area
            in an instant. Depending on how you want to play Kensai, the class is very
            expendable.
            
            Some good ways to play Kensai are:
            
            -   'Samurai Showdown' doesn't have to be used against a target. Since the ability
                allows you practically teleport, you can use this to your advantage by
                teleporting away from an enemy or conflict that you have a low chance of
                winning. Due to the amount of stamina it uses, it is really more of a last
                resort.
            -   If you have a ranged weapon (either a sling or bow), you can try this.
            -   Shoot your target at range and keep an even distance. If you feel the target
                is getting too close, use 'Samurai Showdown' to teleport behind the target,
                then keep shooting at range. This will help limit the damage you take
                significantly if you play your cards right
            -   The Fury you get after dashing through an enemy boosts your critical damage,
                so it's a good idea to have either a light or an illumination spell to
                guarantee a critical hit.
    
    6.  PUGILIST
    
        The Greatest - Pugilists build up a combo counter while attacking unarmed,
        dealing more damage with each consecutive hit. This counter is reset if they
        miss an attack, wait too long, or lose their target. Landing 3 attacks in a row
        will daze the target, landing a 4th will stun it, and landing a 5th will knock
        it prone and deal heavy damage. If the final blow kills the target, the Pugilist
        will be rewarded with a belt of random quality.

        1.  More about the known songs
        
            The Rhapsodist is a class in FARA with a very unique play style.
            
            -   Whenever the Rhapsodist attacks, it plays a note.
            -   The note is dependent if the attack is a normal or a Heavy.
            -   When you sing four notes, it makes a song.
            -   Different songs have different effects.
            -   The order of the notes in the song does matter, unless it's the Cleansing song.
            -   The two notes are short (normal attack) and long (heavy attack).
            -   All buffs applied to allies with songs are also applied to yourself.

            -   \*There's seven different ways of performing the Song of Cleansing:
                -   2S and 2L (in any order) and L - S - S - S
            
            The attacks don't have to be consecutive, and only the last one has to hit a target for the song to start.
            
            For example: you can hit the air three times, travel to another tile,
            wait for a full day and even rest and you will complete the song on
            your next valid attack (as of 0.0.15.18b)
        
        2.  Note
        
            Apparently the spellthief's special spell can't be cast through the /spells
            window, it has to be manually casted through the command prompt atm
            
            But if you type "/cast 3" in the command prompt it should work. Another thing to
            consider is that you can't copy innate abilities (like grasping earth from
            legendary beasts.)

## Damage Types

There are eight types of damage in FARA.

Physical attacks are countered by "Damage Reduction" provided those held shield
items in combination with Resilience and Strength, i suppose.

Magical attacks are countered by your elemental attunement which is enhanced by
your Insight? and a shield spell. Did I get that right?


<a id="org967660a"></a>

### Physical

-   Elemental Effects on hard-attacks.
-   melee
    -   slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing,
    -   (see Radiant hand trait if you're looking for physical resistances)
-   ranged

Elemental runes on your weapon give you a bonus and weaken your target.

If you have more than one elemental rune on your weapon, then they will
alternate with each hard attack you make.

FARA canon seems to be to use a single water-rune on your weapon and nothing
else since a little bit of extra water-attunement will make your rejuvenating
healing spell work ever so much better for you &#x2013; and of course weaken your
foe's water/healing attunement as well.


<a id="org4dbdd97"></a>

### Magical

.. and then there is Arcane, an untyped damage belonging to no element at all.
Mobs don't seem to use it nor do they appear to have resistance against it.
If you feel like doing without the elemental effects, think 'arcane'.

if you use an arcane shield or other rare arcane infused elements you do more
damage and resist arcane spells


<a id="org08a032b"></a>

### Elemental

-   6 pure
    -   (+ arcane in the absence of elements, right? makes it 7 pure types.)
-   15 (16) dual/combo types
-   21 (22) magial means to confuse your self with while learning to play!

Combine two elemental runes into a spell to deliver both types under these
names - which show up in the spell name.

## Factions

When you rank up in a faction, by doing quests for them or bribing one of their
officers with 10..100(200?) medals, you get access to their traits, which give some
very good bonuses.


<a id="orgdd4016d"></a>

### About

1.  Jade circle: Social/stealth

    Is a really good faction for stealthy characters
    (has one of the best traits for spellcasters)

2.  Radiant hand: Combat/Tanking/buffs and debuffs

    Focusing on Strength? go for the hand!
    
    The three first Radiant Hand Traits 
    give you Damage Reduction against Piercing, Slashing and Bludgeoning Damage

3.  Will of the wild: Resource gathering/crafting/exploration

    Is good for crafting a lot of stuff, and getting a lot of loot
    
    Traits will give you options in crafting such as:
    
    -   Reduces material costs of all craftable items
    -   Increases materials gathered from foraging skills

See the **/factions** (aka "**F**") window for a list of Traits and the rank requirements

-   Don’t enter castles of the factions that don’t like you.
-   Fortresses are ok, just not castles
-   Takes a huge amount of medals to become a Legend. Balance with smithing!


<a id="org9a8f338"></a>

### Wanted

Don't think that it goes unobserver when your thieving fails or you start
murdering random people &#x2013; who are mostly/all? aligned with a faction.

I've experimented and see it go from Unknown to
Watched,
Wanted,
Enemy,
Hated,
Despised &
Scourge by/of a Faction!

It may be interresting to try this with a stronger character who has medals enough
to bribe their way back out of a hole. As is, my experimental guy quickly died to
an assassing sent after him.


<a id="org9069177"></a>

### Traits

Check the Faction trait lists through the **/factions** window, click a faction
and choose to see the list of traits and their cost in shards from the menu.

It is technically possible to get traits from multiple factions, but it requires
some grinding as each medal given to a faction will decrease your reputation
with the other two. You can also try to do some Reputation juggling by getting
the Diplomat trait and/or being the Politician class to obtain maximum rep with
more than one faction at a time.

You have three changeable trait slots! In addition to your unchangeable class
trait, you have two minor trait slots and one major trait slot you get to pickup
and repeatedly change out through study and with the help of your Faction.

> On your labyrinthine journeys you're likely to find Manuals that bestow Traits
> upon you. Thus there's no need to rush headlong into alliances with [Factions](#org290cf3b)
> who's ultimate intentions you can't ever be sure about anyway.


<a id="orgb263087"></a>

### Trait Manuals

There are manuals for all Faction specific traits waiting to be found ingame.
I suppose the higher ranked manuals are less frequent.

-   Finding/Grinding Labyrinths


<a id="org9edbded"></a>

## Food

-   Raw food provides some stamina but no healing.
-   Cooked foods provide much more stamina and restore a fixed health%.
-   Its not clear if or how the health boost varies.
-   They are 1u small.
-   Buffs from food **replace** each other.
-   mixtures, dishes and booze can drop from mobs and crates.

[Alchemist](#orgd21a379)'s **Mixtures** provide higher stat bonuses for fewer ingredients and can
be consumed much faster. Throwing Mixtures at enemies will lower the relevant
stats, and throwing Mixtures at other entities will raise the relevant stats.

[Botanists](#org2183e0d) can do all sorts of magic by feeding their babies just about anything.
Their babies evolve when they feed them. Your pets wont.

[Chef](#orgd32c53f)'s **Dishes** provide stat bonuses for four times the duration of Meals, and
grant an effect which fixes the eater's mood to max for an extended period.

Eating and drinking (**/eat**, **/drink**) take time. **Water** and **Mixtures**
are probably hugely important for spellcasters in dire situations, but I'd need
an expert to chime in with their experience as I'm just guessing here.

Whats missing?

-   Is someone tracking the biomes for these things?

-   Don't forget there are 6 more prefixes used with [Elemental Buffs](#org0c2a3c7)!

-   Anything with Fishbones always? produces inedible 'questionable' outcomes.

-   Testing indicates that you get the same amount of health, ~10% from eating cooked items.

Take some of the ultra-small foods to recover stamina during your travels
(and/or to save yourself from drowning) and bring along with a few elemental
runes to cook up Elemental Gourmet Meals right next to, or even in your Dungeon
or Quest site!

Don't forget the wood lest you wind up wanting to cook in the middle of a desert.


<a id="org76562ce"></a>

### Cooking

Everyone can **/harvest** trees and shrubbery, then **/cook** solid **Meals** from
single Ingredients in Campfires and Firepits to restore stamina and heal
themselves and their allies.

The real freaks produce foods with a different prefix and an **extra +** on the
buffs:

-   [Alchemists](#orgd21a379) produce liquid **Mixtures** instead of **Meals** when cooking.
-   [Chefs](#orgd32c53f) produce **Dishes** instead of **Meals** when cooking.

Cook sites:

-   Campfires
    -   are destroyed by immolation more quickly
    -   add a log to get a Bonfire. unsure about effects on cooking

-   Firepits
    -   last forever?
    -   are they faster? have greater capacity?

-   Stove are a thing.
    -   failed to get the recipe.

As you're hanging out surrounded by half a dozen camp-fires plus one, cooking

When you infuse multiple runes into a firepit you'll get the wonderful combo names
used for [Elemental Combos](#org08a032b) applied to your Meals, with the last infused element
determining the elemental attunement your food will provide.

### Stamina

You know that there's sugar in fruit, right?

So why don't you wear yourself out, then try what fruits or other food you might
like to take along your raiding missions. Find a way to determine just how long
it might take to eat or drink and just which of these options of replenishing
your stamina are open to you in combat!

### Curios

(wip)

Gizmos, dodads, mods, infusions.. call them what you want, once you've applied
them to a piece of equipment, you can't get rid of them again. Some of these are
really rare and I can't quite judge which those are, so .. Please don't cry if
you misapply!

Curios can be found and some of the curios, perhaps all of them are

into a sensible homesteader's base eludes me still!

-   Some of these I only know by hearsay, having their sizes and to learn
    something about their utility, if any, would be cool too.

-   Does anyone feel like making up a color-scheme for a living space?

and what about Cages? do they have a use?

All these have the capacity to hold 300 items of arbitrary size.

-   Carts, draggable on the local map
-   Storage Bins, installable

## Locations


<a id="org90f9cc1"></a>

### Location List

Due to the presence of rift-energies in the land, its important that you
bookmark locations your're engaged with. Leaving them unobserved will not be
enough to keep them from drifting away from where you thought they were.

The attention bound by personal and quest bookmarks appears to attract these
drifters while the content of the world around you reorganizes itself when you
sleep. None of the citizens in your world, except perhaps elder and nobles would
appear to be aware of this.

Practically this means that special location like the ones listed here can
**often** be found in areas adjecent to or in the immediate vicinity of the sites
you have bookmarked. Settlements with their histories and many minds appear less
volatile.

All said, a good observer will often find fascinating places, as if by accident,
when they wake up after resting (well sheltered one hopes) in the woods!

tl;dr? Peek into the 8 immediate neighbors of the bookmarks you're given and
possibly walk through the 16 surrounding squares to see what's out there!

Indoor locations such as Castles and Fortresses offer free and secure overnight
lodgings.

-   need more data! and stories from others!

-   inital text stolen, probably from the outdated wiki
-   ty discord denizens for your insights and feedback!

Cleared location where you might have a non hostile but unfriendly enemy mount
appear to attrack scoundrel after a night or two spent there. So don't be
surprised if you find yourself suddenly blinded after having stepped on a trap
while getting shot at if you tolerate these untamable collaborators!


<a id="orgd447f61"></a>

### Encounters

1.  Abandoned Shack

    Single Building in the woods, no hostiles, tool-chest .. and a single powerful trap.
    
    -   need more data

2.  Ambushes

    Going somewhere new, you spy a Big Chest out in the open.. just a dash away and
    noone's here.. you search, and seing nothing you dash.. into your doom.
    
    Careful with the greed man, if it looks to good to be true, it is.
    
    You've been warned, not that it matters. Good luck getting out ouf there!
    
    Note: I've had a BigChest appear out of the blue the moment i found my first
    young cat while on a woodcutting trip in the nearby woods. I wonder if that was
    some kind of nod to potential cat-lovers, but i definitely made sure to search
    on almost every step on the way to pick up that loot.
    
    There were no hostiles on the map, and the cat and cow seem to have become fast
    friends down at the stables. (file under 'ambushed by cats')

3.  Arcane Obelisk

    "Powerful Magic"
    
    Obelisk building let's you upgrade spells
    
    -   Upgrades for spells you've learned.
    -   Costs the same as if you had unlocked an Obelisk in your settlement!
    -   The cheapest and most thrilling way to upgrade your spells is to hunt for
        [ruinous ruins](#org8f5cd04) since you'll always? find an obelisk shard among the loot there.
        A shards is just large enough power a single upgrades so perhaps save it for
        the last upgrade or two to save 20 or 35 shard, paying for it with the risk
        you're taking on. Just be clear about what you're getting into and read the
        notes for the [Location List](#org90f9cc1) to tweak the ruin's [Difficulty](#org22541ad).

4.  Burning House

    **Danger Will Robinson**
    
    The Burning House can be a real oh-sh\*t experience. It could be on any tile that
    you stumble on pyromanic imps that shoot you with magma right when you land. I
    didn't find any until I had complete all the buildings in Relica and it may be
    ok to save your paranoia until then.
    
    Extrapolating from my random encouter I suspect the imps were not really
    malicious, simply driven to madness by the guy making horrible music. I mean,
    wouldn't he live in town with his <random instrument> if people appreciated his
    music?
    
    I wish I had not forgotten to **/grab** and drag the unconscious SOB off the edge
    of the map to get him looked after. Which makes me think of something! Do you
    know that if you're dragging something or someone, all you need to do to let go,
    is to hold something else in that hand. Say you happen to get attacked, just
    draw your weapon and you'll let go what you were pulling.
    
    And hey, and hey, most people dont mind if you drag them around. The ingame
    message about 'attacking' is just worded a bit strongly for most circumstances.

5.  The Farmer

    A real **<Gem>** from Discord!
    
    "It was a random encounter, there was 1 small building, 2 commoners, and 1 farmer
    NPC. The farmer NPC only gave quests to collect and return 2-3 crops (items)
    from around the map, rewarding a tool chest or small check for each completed
    quest.
    
    I could repeat these indefinitely, and after a while, the chests became refined,
    and then artisan. The artisan small chests gave artisan items, which I mostly
    salvaged, giving me runic shards.  Basically, the farmer is a safe and infinite
    (albeit a little tedious) source of runic shards."

6.  Graveyard

    There's a lot of tombstones in this place. It's been said that there's more to
    this place that hasn't been discovered yet.
    
    -   digging up and smashing all the tombstones hasnt revealed anything to me yet.
    -   good place to collect soil (for pottery?) :)

7.  Scouts

    What are these locations called again?
    
    -   Found in the wilderness.
    -   Belong to a faction. Are they all Will of the Wild?
    -   Scouts give waypoints to settlements
        within a range they know about
        All scouts within, say, 50km? 75..100km? around Relica seem to know the same thing.

8.  Shrines (on the map?)

    A powerful artifact of one of the gods rests behind the locked door which you
    can /inspect to know what you need to do to open it. On each side of the shrine
    there are statues, which have had a runestone pried out of them. One of the
    statues is probably in disrepair.

9.  Summoning Circle (on the map?)

    -   Rift beasts
    -   Maybe take 3 CRPs to a Summoning Circle?

10. Trader

    Also another random encounter is a trader.
    
    -   Though AFAIK no one actually knows what to do with them.
    
    TRADER&#x2026; He said he had nothing to trade, so i gave him some loot, left the map
    to get some more, came back, he was gone .. but had left me a BigChest.  Please
    try that if you see one and confirm!
    
    (This seeming discover appears to have surfaced a bug and atm, an upcoming update
    will reset the game of figuring out what traders do. Perhaps they'll soon trade?
    Stay tuned!)

11. Travelers/Caravan

    (old info)
    
    These travelers seem to have a traitor between them.
    
    -   Talk to them to figure out who it is!
    
    As you traverse the world of FARA you might come upon caravans along your way. A
    caravan consist of 5 travellers and talking to any of them you'll find out that
    they have recently been attacked. They suspect one of their own, and this gives
    you the chance to play detective.
    
    Each person will list how long they've been with the group, their personal
    reason for travelling, as well as a good and bad thing to do at their
    destination. These are the clues to identify the odd one out.
    
    As a reward for solving the mystery you gain the following:
    
    -   1x big chest,
    -   1x artisan tool kit,
    -   2x randomized tools,
    -   1x iron shiv,
    -   1x lockpick
    
    1.  Tips for solving the mystery
    
        Typically the activities mentioned fall into the following categories [study],
        [trade], [relaxing], [family], and [entertainment]. You will need to talk to all
        the travellers and figure out which one they report as the absolute worst to do
        at the destination. If two activities are tied, one of them is unlikely to be
        used as an alibi by anyone. Confronting and accusing the traveller who says
        they're going there for this purpose will unlock a fight. The culprit will turn
        hostile and try to kill you. Two ambushers will show up and assault the culprit
        first, and you second. After winning the fight you can peacefully collect the
        rewards.
        
        At the type of writing, it is unclear if telling on the culprit will just fail
        the event.
        
        Once the event is over all travellers that have not been accused (you could
        accuse the wrong one and fail the event) will offer a quest, similar to
        commoners in towns.
    
    2.  Dude!
    
        I wound up accusing someone based on nothing more than them saying they
        wanted peace and quiet and were going to a place for the entertainment.
        
        Mayhem ensued, loot dropped and in the end only the guy sitting the furthest
        away from the action survived the assault by the accused's pals. three dead
        to solve a robbery. wth! 
        
        now the shivering sole survivor and inheritor of all the trashy loot i can't
        haul away want to make funeral music with a clay triangle. a clay triangle!
        one moment while i get him one..
        
        wait! one body is missing. ah! one more survivor after all. he freaked out and
        ran away.  good for him.

12. Unconscious Adventurer

    -   some are fakers,
    -   the others..


<a id="org6eb322d"></a>

### Locations

1.  Campsite

    Just a wilderness shack. Usually houses a recalcitrant Outlaw of one sort or the
    other. Some are trying to leave their prior associates behind and change their
    ways, others are just looking to hole up until the heat passes down. Too bad for
    them that they see you as the threat to their lives that you are. I mean, you
    would have talked to them first if they hadn't gone all hostile on you, right?
    
    Poor Sobs, usually don't even have furniture where they sleep.

2.  Castle

    A noble of one of the factions lives inside here, protected by many guards and
    assassins. You can /interact with the noble and complete missions to earn you
    reputation with the faction they belong to. Rumour has it there might be
    valuables if you should dare fight the whole castle.
    
    -   So far its been safe to salvage the throne for 1 iron.
    -   Don’t enter castles of the factions that don’t like you
        -   seems like one wants to turn off the lights in there, perhaps even
            dismanteling the braziers and go in with dark-vision companions before
            killing everyone

3.  Colliseum

    Inside here you can find a champion to challenge. You have to enter alone, and
    earn reputation and a lot of treasure if you can defeat the champion.
    
    probably requires several pieces of masterwork equipment and some godlike stats

4.  Dens

    Inside you can find a legendary beast to fight.
    
    -   Unlit.
    -   Denizens have darkvision and, likely posess means to immobilize you.
    -   Crazy scout by 'move forward, throw lit torch and retreat' might let you
        trade a blight for a newly scouted monster. is that worth it?

5.  Dungeon

    A series of corridors and rooms, guarded by traps, ancient guardians and many
    horrors lurking in the dark. In the first room there's an altar with a rune of
    some element. You can find a lot of treasure inside. Remember to bring something
    to light the way ahead and /mark the ground to not get lost.
    
    -   the ultimate adventure experience. these are why you invest time into the game
    -   waypoint outside and make camp there, bring foods, buffs, companions and rest well.
    
    -   You can peek in relative safety, remember though what killed the cat!
    -   Good help is hard to find, so don't judge the boss by his minions;
    
    I used to do /mark in dungeons before we had a local map, and before local
    waypoints were a thing It was very very easy to get lost in there, and no way to
    quickly exit

6.  Encampment/ Unknown Camp

    -   single building
    
    or perhaps 3..5 of them with a batch of inhabitants greeting you and joining
    battle with you before you even knew what happened.
    
    if that's the case count yourself lucky! these guys have furniture galore and
    since you were short some 20 wooden blocks you could not have come to a better place.
    
    just be careful entering the buildings since not everyone who lives there had a
    chance to greet you earlier. you never know what these higher level guys were
    thinking leaving the fighting to their minions and all that.
    
    an unusual crew with their own agenda, you overheard their leader talking about
    ambushing a guy that happened to actually not be you. The wanted poster you
    found, you better take that with you to an actually dangerous place before
    looking at it more closely. You know.. higher risk, higher rewards mean you 
    know that you don't want to read it back in Relica, right?
    
    Bring some pals. Makes it easier to checkmate the whole site at once. Plus you
    might need someone to help you carry all that wood back home. They usually
    have a good variety of booze on hand too, those louts.
    
    -   Faction camps with
        -   5ish assorted opponents of the same level in the open
        -   3ish leader types, same lvl in a house
        -   wanted postet, big-chest
    -   clearing them seems to not hurt your rep with anyone.
        maybe once you have rep that changes.
    -   5ish buildings offer 3+ random pieces of furniture
    -   its probably where you'll find your first benches

7.  Fortress

    -   safe to salvage the doors for 6? ot 8? iron until you have picked a faction
    -   this is where you donate medals in exchange for reputation and access to traits
    -   dropping some walls/maybe buildings as one enters a hostile fortress and going
        with some meat-shields might work to get started on what may be the 'help thy
        faction' endgame. but idk. i will find out.
    -   word is that its ok to enter hostile faction fortresses.

8.  Hunting grounds

    Starts to spawn after completing certain amount of quests in one of the
    villages. In other words, You can get hunting ground quests once you've become a
    hero of a settlement.
    
    On entering the hunting grounds you can find a group of hunters heavily injured,
    and a lot of corpses around the place. After talking to one of them you can
    accept a mission to help them against the Rift Beast that left them in that
    condition.
    
    Rift beasts are one of the toughest opponents in FARA, one of them comes to
    fight you after accepting to help the hunters that show up in the hunting
    grounds.
    
    They are a challenge for any type of character, so being prepared is very important.
    
    -   in other words, forget about it for a while.
    -   found a random young rift beast maybe 100km from relica.
    -   found my first camp randomly in the wild ~320km from relica.
        -   had never taken the quest offered me in relica.

9.  Labyrinth

    Dont go exploring them in the dead of night without a [light](#org2fbd671)!
    
    Safe and super high rewards and likely to confuse the hell out out of you for
    longer than you might have patience for. Be prepared for {Masterwork} items and
    other items of awe .. in 90..120 minutes.
    
    1.  Leaving a trail
    
        These scribbles might help you to mark up the laby while you're doing so that
        you can leave and come back without loosing the place you were last exploring!
        
        <table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
        
        
        <colgroup>
        <col  class="org-left" />
        </colgroup>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td class="org-left">setkey 1 mark red</td>
        </tr>
        
        
        <tr>
        <td class="org-left">setkey 2 mark green</td>
        </tr>
        
        
        <tr>
        <td class="org-left">setkey 3 mark blue</td>
        </tr>
        
        
        <tr>
        <td class="org-left">setkey 4 clearmark</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        
        -   There is a labyrinth, i go in
        -   at a junction, i mark
        -   green from whence i came
        -   blue everywhere i'm not going yet
        -   i reach a dead-end and retrace my step
        -   at the junction from whence i came
        -   i mark the dead-end path red, and clear a blue
        -   and on i go.
        -   when i reach a blue, i mark it red & **retrace my step.**
        -   when i reach i a green and blue i red my step and clear a blue.
        
        And working out the little nuances that make this actually work is, as they used
        to say back when books were a thing.. "left as an exercise for the reader."
        
        &#x2013; the Mintaur
    
    2.  Using Waypoints
    
        Mantecarl chimes in with this incredible paint saving measure:
        
        -   I've been doing this thing in labyrinths were I set a local waypoint in all 4
            clearings, so that I can get to them if I ever ran into a corridor with no
            exits &#x2013; saves a lot of time!
        
        I tried this method, with a **/setkey** for **/slw** and **/clearlocalwaypoint**,
        leaving local waypoints at junctions i was not sure about, then zooming right
        back to them. Works brilliantly this way and allowed me to clear a lab in record
        time.
        
        Leveling up my character and gear via the legendaries you can find here won't
        absolve me from the need to quest for tools and medals by continuing to assist
        the elder and others, but it gave me the ability and motivation to go from
        exploring a distance of up to 200km to setting up a little outpost 380km from
        Relica.

10. Masterwork forge

    -   These let you upgrade a (refined) and <artisan>'d item once more.
    -   I remember hunting for these in the nightmare versions of 2019.

11. Ruins

    You come across 6/7? to 9 delapidated buildings in this frequent, somewhat hard
    yet doable encounter.
    
    In the beginning count yourself lucky if you manage to dash to the egde
    undetected. If you have some wood on hand keep in mind that you can get out if
    you're near the edge and that you can place the occasional extra wall or
    building to beef up your position &#x2013; especially if you're playing melee &#x2013; to
    break the line of sight against what will inevitably be small groups of often stealthy
    casters coming after you here.
    
    -   stealth-clustered magic attackers and friends all appear to use the same element!
    -   bring some [elemental foods](#org0c2a3c7) for yourself and your team, and of course a beverage!
    -   getting the Big Chest from the local mini boss doesnt mean you're safe!
    -   move to the edge if dashing to the next blg will leave you exhausted!
    -   use stealth, enter, drop building, move to cover!
    -   sevral ruined storage chest. one obsidean shard always drops here.
    
    Sometimes though it seems as if the crew guarding the ruins has been tipped of
    about your plans to attack them, and they will all be standing by your spawn point.
    
    In these circumstances being a Gatekeeper allows you to put on your second big
    shield, cast protect, a ward of fury for maximum retaliation while you attempt
    to get out of that mess. If you're lucky, almost all the spellcaster will kill
    themselves trying to hurt as you're making your exit.
    
    I'm not sure that I could have managed half the research in this guide any other
    way.
    
    -   Usually lots of Great Food from Chefs and Alchemists who must have once had a
        colony here.

### Just plain cool

Random things and places one might never see again..

-   An Equestrian NPC riding a Gryphon
-   An Island in the middle of a deep lake
-   Rivers running through a map

1.  Cow pasture

    Found a serene pasture with a cow, a little lake, lots of flowers, and a
    BigChest. I petted the cow a zillion times, fed her a flower and took her to
    the nearest settlement.

2.  A shrouded figure

    Just that. Empty woods, Orange Square. Hollow eyes look at me and the figure
    vanishes before I can inspect them. Spooky. Is he the guy taking all the kids I
    can't find? Was he in one of the graves I dug up? What did I stumble on? I just
    needed a wooden log! Should I dig there? /pug wonders on, then, wait! ..
    
    Awakening as from a dream, he recalls the moment his memories began. There he
    had seen that figure loitering over one of the bandits that keep coming after
    him and his cow. Did that figure save him from a certain death? Is he somehow
    connected to that society of researchers only elders seem to know about?

## Materials

Trying to pack all the info and stats about the things you craft with in here.


<a id="org7903c15"></a>

### Wiki preamble

I sooo hope that the wiki/source is more than mostly right on this info

-   source: <https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Crafting_Materials>

There is an abundance of different materials and most of them seem to be
associated with some kind of stat altering capabilities, that you can gain by
wearing or holding the item. In addition to the material you use when crafting,
the item you are crafting itself may have some base properties making up the
total attribute impact.

Weaponry, jewellery, and armour is made from wood, bone, scale, glass, and
minerals, while clothing items are made from cloths and furs - with a few
overlaps such as boots.

Note that at this time the precise number of stat pluses given by each material
is unknown, as it is not equivalent to the number of arrows a piece of equipment
has.

-   (stat)> gives +1
-   (stat)>> gives +2 or +3
-   (stat)>>> gives +4, +5, or +6

Each additional nth arrow gives an additional n possible boosts (4 arrows giving
between +7 and +10, etc.)


<a id="org27b8680"></a>

### Notes

-   Crafting appears to take 100 (105?) moments. fwiw.
-   Steel, Obsidian, Velvet, Diamond items appear to be dropped from crates promising
    items of 'normal' quality. Makes you think, doesn't it?


<a id="orgcfc67e8"></a>

### Everyday materials

Useful **Very common** Materials without effects on your stats.

## NPCs

As elsewhere the stories I tell about the different characters and their
fantastic schemes and relations are entirely fantastic and straight from my
imagination.

I write them for the same reason that I don't cheat: Even a little bit of
storytelling keeps the fantasy alive and prevents play from becoming a grind.


<a id="orgc30c18b"></a>

### Champions

Challenge them once you're past the "Age of Steel", even then you might regret it!
Remember they are Faction Leaders.


<a id="orgce53b12"></a>

### Dummy

The combat dummies you'll find in all settlements give you a taste of the damage
put out by attackers of different ranks. By going between towns and challenging
different dummies you can experiment with your offensive options to learn how
small differences between weapons and styles that don't show up when you look at
only item stats.

That experiment might be quite a geeky thing, but we should have a table here to
demonstrate the power hiding in different [Skill Brackets](#orgb876623).


<a id="org6ec7b35"></a>

### Elder

The real power in fara; Colludes with the Researchers and likely with that hostile shaded
figure that saved your life when your memories first began.


<a id="org8645c2d"></a>

### Escortees

Source of infinite unique items of middling power .. which .. when you have
collected way to many, might allow you to think yourself as well equipped as
someone solidly in 'The Age of Steel'. Perhaps a little better than that; But
as the quality of their Thank you's vary quite a bit, its not unheard of to find
their dead bodies in Dungeons and Monster Dens.


<a id="org4b207d2"></a>

### Gambler

The Gambler/ "Shady Gamer" is actually really useful!

If you have a ton of runic dust, you can use the gambler to get any tool recipes
you don't have yet, and more importantly, get very rare materials.

He gives you 25% odds, for an average price of 4 dust per win :) 

Not bad at all. A friend suggests you take the odd because you savscumming the
shady isnt just shadierer, it won't guarantee you an outcome either. Still, if
you must at least keep betting on the same choice each time or simply make
[another choice each next round](https://www.startpage.com/sp/search?query=monty+hall+problem) and stick with that. I can't believe I just told
you that!


<a id="org2d0ae0e"></a>

### Guards

These will gang up on you and you'll want to be really careful to not get the Elder
involved in a fight because he will end your game by kicking you out of 'his' world
permanently.


<a id="org40e64d3"></a>

### Nobles

Also appear to colludes with the researchers, but their power and influence in
the realm is nowhere near to that of the Elders. Not much is known about the
transformation of Nobles to Elders, nor do all that many survive into old age.


<a id="org616d106"></a>

### Riddler

Random guy who found and ate the only mushrooms ever seen in FARA, blowing out
his brains, asks you a single question before falling into some kind of stupor.


<a id="org8114f9b"></a>

### Smuggler

Insight Good+, Charm Average:

    "You give 27 Crystal Ingots to Cheeky Smuggler. 
    ..A Cheeky Smuggler nods and casually places 13 Iron Ingots on the ground."

Insight Good+, Charm Good+:

    "You give 27 Crystal Ingots to Cheeky Smuggler. 
    ..A Cheeky Smuggler nods and casually places 13 Iron Ingots on the ground."

Iron and Crystal are both uncommon. He gave back half of the same rarity,
rounded down, Charm doesnt matter to him it seems, would have seen it round
differently..


<a id="orge737c30"></a>

### Thief

You forgot to close the door one night and now there's that shifty looking
fellow standing right next to you, decked out in your newly upgraded gear,
asking for assistance.

Hmm.. somehow you learn that 

-   crafting takes about 105 moments.
-   unconscious people don't drown in wells.
-   its morning, daylight. you're going to loose rep or your gear no matter what
-   /grab /choke /eat zesty-dish/meal, /wear fin-gear /stealth /rob them blind ..
    all cost you faction rep because you'll need to end the guy and hope to loot
    your stuff that way. and ending costs you. not to much if your thieving fails
    when stealthed, but still..

and then *mustardfiend* chimes in thus:

> I had something similar happen to me in a past run, where I rested
> overnight at a castle. Woke up, had a bunch of good stuff swiped, and there was
> a random commoner just standing there with those very items. Tried stealing them
> back, which didn't work, and they started running away. Out of desperation, I
> yelled at them, hoping the guards would dogpile the thief. They dropped the
> items and ran off. Guards just sat there.

**/say thief** gets them to drop everything they stole and act embarrassed.

That does not appear to work in the wilderness where there are no guards around.

pug/more:

After winning by assembling the key, I met my first thief because I had gotten
complacent about closing the door in Relica. Since then I've experimented, and
thieves have appeared **every** single night, sometimes taking not just my weapon
but also upto two pieces of armor. That's going from never to always, making me
think that **winning was a bad idea!**  Lets hope I've run into a bug here.


<a id="org830222c"></a>

### Townies

See Desperate Times. 


<a id="org5d738b3"></a>

### Trader

A bug was fixed. TBD.


<a id="org01f065e"></a>

## Party

-   Press "**p**" for party details.

-   [Commanders](#org0721e4d) can support three party members, all other classes can manage just two.
    -   It not clear to me if [Botanist's](#org2183e0d) plants count against the limit
        -   [Mad Scientist](#orgf416894) creations do, yet they can have 2 at once.

-   Escort quests' Escortees don't count against your party-size-limit.

-   [Musical Instruments](#org318c52f) much bigger than yourself can be held to cheer up your
    party via **/play**.

-   **/Dance** is also a mood-booster. In some locations it winds up killing
    otherwise friendly NPC's who arn't [Fishmongers](#org8adceed). You'll know it when you see it.

-   Your stamina will return when you leave the map after dancing, but not that
    of your party members!. Wait an hour "**>**" to let them catch their breath!

-   In other games, i often like travelling alone. In FARA, not yet.

-   [Talk](#orge276d31) to your Party Members to chat and control their equipment and general stance.


<a id="orgc074c0b"></a>

### Mercenaries

In general these appear to be much stronger
than you would suspect them to be from their listed skill bracket.

-   have a nice clickety screen to equip them through
-   can't learn spells from tombs
-   can't learn traits from manuals
-   will give back your stuff
    -   must click-items or "/say drop you xyz" 
        -   makes it ok to hired them for a closer look at their stats.
        -   have them drop their stuff before they get killed as 
            "the dead have nothing to steal," right?


<a id="org0f52656"></a>

### Pets

Pet animals till they get ecstatic, then feed some stuff. If there's room in your party
they should join right away.

-   Wild boars can be found in forests and they're absolute chads in combat
-   Replace them with Grizzlies asap and upgrade from there
-   Other bears are timid, they run away scared and sometimes pull animal
    attackers. after **/exit** they come back. fun during the early days.

If you want to, say, have a private chat with the local nobles or hunt the
wumpus, i mean minotaur, then its good to know that you can dismiss your animal
pals from the party without them holding a grudge against you. If you want them
to rejoin you later you'll wish you had already dropped some food to bribe them
with right where you left them!


<a id="orge7e73cf"></a>

### Mounts

-   Saddles
-   Enemy mounts, /inspect, not hostile, not tameable. attract new hostiles
    overnight!?

## Quests

You can figure these out by your self, don't sweat them. If there's trouble you
had to run from, kids or monsters or items and belongings you can't find, drop
the damn quest without penalty and get a new batch from the elder, the always
needy people of the realm and/or those workers you brought into your settlement.

Here are some really dumb observations about quests:

There are more types tied to specific locations. I need to add more info here.


<a id="org3d32953"></a>

### Beastslayer you!

Listen man, I know you want to make a name for yourself, impress the Elder and
all that; Don't deny it, we've all been there. But let me give me you a hint
about this thing you dont want to ask about &#x2026; Those tracks you're looking for,
they have the beast's name in it and 9 out of ten times you find them in one of
the 8 directions just a single step away from the settlement. That other time,
you'll to take two steps to find them. 

See, I saw you pondering. Yep, that's why you couldn't find that monster the
other day. Now be careful reading the tracks!


<a id="orgc56876f"></a>

### Desperate Times

You know that times are desperate when almost overyone, no, make that everyone
you meet that's not out to kill you offers you ancestral heirlooms as rewards
for things you've never seen.

Needy as they are, they want foods that noone in their right mind would care to
eat, Weapons and other items you have never heard of. And they send you to
[unknown places](#org0e5ed38) too. Always they have needs in places you've never been, make you
deliver the weirdest trinkets or their odd selves to hard to find people
and places. The heirlooms from their illustrious ancestors, those medals,
just like their inane request never seem to run out.

Well, ok, some of the folks that you ferry between places are actually
interesting to talk to and would appear new to the game and a bit naive as
they just give you unique and valuable items that you can actually use.

Maybe you stumbled upon some underground railroad where people of different
factions are relocating all over the map because they are planning something.

(at this point pug starts dancing to cheer himself up.)

Ok, at least sometimes they had no idea they were paying waay too much for your
services.


<a id="org1ea0294"></a>

### Escort Quests

-   seems you can always?/often? find a delivery and an escort, or two escorts
    with the same destination!
    -   makes it doubly worthwhile to **/slw** waypoint your npc so you can check what
        they want without keepingg too many notes by hand.

-   escortees do not count towards the party limit.
    -   for ex, with merc, pet and 2 escortees "P" showed '4 of 2'.
-   probabably easier when started in the morning than at night
    -   (well&#x2026; if you're escorting guys stronger than yourself, then it might
        profit to travel at night for what seems is a greater chance at getting
        ambushed)
-   tbd if escortees tolerate detours and or 'excessive' camping out.
-   apparently they are a source of infinite custom/random weapons and gear
    -   atm the wh crucible seems like a good place to keep those.


<a id="org291dfab"></a>

### Missing Kid Quests

(from the notes of earlier pug.)

Stupid Kids! First you can never find them, then you do find one, and when you
bring them home in the middle of the night they want to play hide and seek and
you have to find them in 15 minutes or so. Totally Bogus! aaaargh.

Yet again you need to build a shelter. And you need search. At least without
either I've not found a single kid yet. Then you need to rest until morning so
you don't need to make light to find them again whence back in town and they
start playing their games. For that you need to have [local waypoints](#org9c881c5) by which to
move yourself through the settlement without going nuts. Do you have those?

And then you learn about how to make Burlap Dolls. Or perhaps they have that
very last exclusive item elite tier BP you had forgotten you wanted. I might
never learn what they are about cause I can't find the buggers!

Sometimes I find tracks leading to unknown dens instead of children. Are these
really just another type of innvitation to suicide myself?  Do i really need to
press "s" so that I **/search** every square inch of the site? Or should I stop
being of attracting attention and just run around the location and **/shout come
here**? Probably.


<a id="org672e7f8"></a>

### Suicide Quests

(excerpt from a letter by future pug.)

When you get to a new settlement a cheeky elder there is likely to invite you,
the stranger, to suicide by quest.

Accept then drop any kill-a-champion and other suspicious sounding quests after
visiting their locations without entering. Turn their game against them by going
there to scout for landmarks of interrest in the general area. Enter a few
random tiles nearby to look for 'who knows what' that spawned there!

Wait with the scary quests until you have legendary stats and artisan equipment,
or something close to that. Or wait until you are already thriving at a place
even further from Relica than where you first got the suicide invitations.

If you rush yourself, [you'll die](#orgf52f03a). Farawella!


<a id="org7ecee23"></a>

## Runes

The section on [Spells](#org6403d59) explains how to think about and create them from the Runes
listed and detailed here.

I dug, fished and purchased a lot of runes in order to compile these lists and
believe them to be complete and accurate, at least for the time. Although not
sortable in the way of the [wiki](https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Spellcrafting), this should now be your goto-reference for
Spellcrafting.


<a id="org5f99e7f"></a>

### Effector Runes

If they are suffering from an effect, the caster is cleansed from these effects
when they cast the spell causing it. To make this work, casting Silencing is
possible even when you are silenced.

If you are burning, and don't have that spell, stop, drop and /roll.

Blinding, 
Burning, 
Charm,
Enlightenment,
Fortification,
Fury, 
Illumination, 
Intoxication, 
Poison, 
Quickness,

4.  Notes

    -   Forces are hugely useful, especially compared to other spells
        -   I had a Thunder Force of Quickness in one run from a labyrinth
        -   knocking people back 3 tiles for a relatively small stamina cost
            If you get rejuve on that, you're VERY good off

-   AOE Spells apply their elemental debuffs against all targets in range

-   **Meteor** spells are delayed by 8 moments/turns at all levels

-   **Blasts** only work against hostiles, not your party members.

-   **Retaliation** hits Melee, Magical and Ranged attacker with a portion of the
    damage they threw at you, not the damage you took. E.g., in the extreme, they
    will kill themselves without you taking any damage. Still, the damage
    reflection isn't all that great even at high stats but if you can spare the
    spell slot, try an Arcane Ward (no elemental runes,) combined with Fury,
    Rejuvenation or any other effector rune.

Pick a number for the elemental runes you want to keep today and **/salvage** the
rest to turn them into shards/dust. Rune shards and Medals are 'currency' in
this game. What you do with the "named runes" above is up to you. Salvage them I
would not.

        your inventory space is huge
-   what would be the ideal food/drink to take?
-   enhanced iron shovel and workbench in inventory
-   should be possible once you get the tool recipes from the first other settlement you visit.
-   oh, have a rope on you while getting used to digging, just in case you slip and fall.

1.  Dig and or Fish.. rather alike, no?

    -   haven't fished yet, so i can't quite compare
    
    -   Fishing with an iron fishing rod used to be viable for Fishmonger, but I spent
        an entire artisan iron fishing rod with Fishmonger and didn't get a single
        rune

2.  Experiments

    As a reality check on digging, I performed these experiments at a nice looking
    beach 25km from home. The shack came in really handy during my travels since I
    wound up with quite a few ingots and wound up sleeping there several times.
    
    The results of my first/only two test runs are shown below.
    The results surprised badly!
    
    -   counter-intuitive
    -   this trashes my understanding of the defintion of the stats

-   Carrying a shield makes all stamina based actions more expensive.
-   Shields do blunt-damage and there's nothing wrong with holding two of them.

## Skill Brackets

Stats are reported in the character screen "**c**" where you can see your relative
skill as determined by a skill bracket. The brackets are made up of several
levels of individual **+** or **-** gained from gear and/or buffs.

I have this notion that it might be possible to make a table that roughly
presents the words indicating enemy strength..

## Spells

(expert info is on the way)

-   See [Obelisk](#org4c949f1) for Spell-levels and leveling

Basically, you

-   chose an elemental rune to determine what type of damage and what elemental
    effect it does,
-   a “stabilizer” to determine what type of spell it is (long range, AoE, etc)
    and
-   an effector rune to apply additional effects when you cast it (like blinding
    enemies, getting buffs on yourself, etc

More:

-   Spell type + 2 elements + effect  adds random stabilizer
-   If you don't use any elemental runes, only a stabilizer and effector, you get an arcane spell
-   You can put 2 spells on weapons and armor.  (scrolls /use
-   Curse spell + any damaging spell is a really good combo to get
-   in case you want to know spear and blade are generally considered good spells

Shielding:

-   Two elements (preferably including water)
    -   rune of shields + rune of rejuvenation gives what I consider the best spell in the game.
-   Because shield increases attunement to all elements, but does so more so for
    the elements included in its spell. This makes it so you can max an attunement
    with a shield of that element + 3(? 2? it's been a while since I played) runes
    on Masterwork equipment.

New:

-   Okay, something I did discover is that you can make randomized spells with
    just elemental runes
-   Think you can add a thing to document that?
-   for ex:
    -   Dark + earth rune 
        -   example: "moon force - cast a force of earth and darkness to damage the target"
    -   Two earth gave me a tome of earth shield, then an earth chain


<a id="org01e18da"></a>

### Scrolls

If I was an [Artificer](#org9f590f8) I might know something about them. But I'm not. At this
point I just just them into a waterproof container in the warehouse for use in
Dungeons later on.

Doing that I've learned that there are scrolls that do and scrolls that teach.

Here's what I know about these


<a id="orgee2b7a7"></a>

### Spell-tombs

The second kind of is obviously better and rarer and I get the sense that the
someone who makes them was more likely to use his or her rarest runes on them so
that they could learn their complicated spells at will in the future. But as all
of the uncommon runes seem rarest to me at this point, I can't judge that right.

One day I'll crack the secret of that secret organization connecting the elders,
nobles and the shaded figure who at least saved my life if he didn't outright
summon me into this world..


<a id="orgc662e50"></a>

### You must have a healing spell

-   It's recommended to use a Rune of Rejuvenation
-   More water attunement = more healing on water-infused-weapon heavies
-   Rejuvenation is very powerful and you only seem to need a single rune to make
    a spell from it. (powerful subject to ..insert yeah long disclaimer here <g>)

1.  Water Chain of Rejuvenation

    I wound up making a "Water Chain of Rejuvenation" and upgraded it using Obelisk
    Shards until it became "Flawless". Its not that great with my stats yet but it
    doubles as an offensive spell which keeps enemies where they are while i heal a
    little every turn for a few turns. It might be awesomer for a ranged class to
    use chain spells, but its good enough to keep melee guys from ganging up on me
    too badly.
    
    I know you experts out there are saying to yourselves.. what an idiot, doesn't
    he know.. and I want to stop you right there! I know its not perfect, but its
    fine to have to drop an item from your pack if there's not anything else in
    range for you to cast the chain on.
    
    Anyway.. I had no shield runes when I made the spell 50 days ago. And I still
    don't have one, nor did I get another rejuvenation rune since. So if you like
    hoarding to figure things out, try not to be stupid about it, these things are
    meant to be used .. and you can always spend a week fishing and digging at a
    beach. I will ;)


<a id="org98826b1"></a>

### Notes on Elemental Damage

*mantecarl*

I did some testing about the light element, apparently at no attunement the
illumination debuff lasts for about a single attack

At max level it's about 10 moments

The critical damage doesn't seem to scale with attunement, just its duration

Right after the illumination fades, the target is !revealed for a single turn

Still not sure if +critical damage stacks with other sources

Ok, this may not be conclusive, but an obsidian mace with a |hardened tack|
takes about 4 hits to kill a combat dummy. If you have the Fury condition it
takes only 3 hits

## Weaponry

Derived from [Mishaal's Compendium](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TK8xF1WbIa_C2U8MkLYVoELI1V3aNUsllLEzgZfX5vg/edit?usp=sharing).

-   Armors are listed under Equipment.

-   The main difference between weapons is only in their heavy attack and the stat
    they scale with. **Size does not matter**, here at least.

-   Most combat RNG was removed (anything that says "chance to&#x2026;" is probably no
    longer a thing).

-   I've seen some talk about stats that track well-used and newly-used weapons
    being different somehow somewhere, the info being in a hidden stat. Please write
    if you can fill in the details!


<a id="org941271d"></a>

### Melee

I suppose that all of these weapons can be thrown at opponents to damage them.

1.  Types

    The lists below still want to get arranged by these weapon types:

All Ranged Weapons, are based on Finesse.

The Sling and likely all thrown weapons, can also use Strength.

-   Throw Darts/Arrows/Stones? Are these the goto thrown weapons?

Attack speed was removed, now each attack takes one turn regardless of
weapon - likely making quivers and bandoliers (which gave the speed boni)
largely cosmetic/flair items. (I saw something about that. need to check!)

# Pug's Notes

Look, I wrote this!


<a id="org2fddc88"></a>

## The Ages

As you will see later in this guide there are several tiers of materials in
FARA. And for argument's sake lets call the main material you're using and
finding, equivalent to being in an age.

You'll be able to survive many if not most of the random encounters near Relica
with relative ease since the Amateur opponents you meet so close to the hub of
lowest difficulty don't have equipment better than yours.

Spending time near Relica allows you to not just learn the game but collect any
number of recipes for later use since your ability to re-craft anything you find
using materials is unmatched. Getting these materials, learning the nuances of
your gear and how to enhance it properly lets you you advance advancing to
somet like a later age.


<a id="org8327f19"></a>

## The Magic

As you find your basic stats and damage resistance risen to something like 'the
iron' age Magic, that is elemental attacks become more of an issue for you.

Enter the elemental resistance which you now learn to give to your gear by
applying runes to it. Letting these get to average and better is quite a 
challenge and a profound mystery at first.

You have access to elemental runes that you can apply to your gear, situational
food and drink providing buffs, even a Commander Level Faction Trait to help
resist the most devious of enemies!


<a id="orgdfbd66f"></a>

## Strategy

Maybe I don't really have one!

(Notes from Garon)

ATM, landing in relica in the middle of my house, on top of a crate, surrounded by 8 others,
with excesses stored in the warehouse still works out great.

leveling up my gear seemed a good thing in the beginning, but now i'm playing it differently,
and it looks like my next game might be all about finding and farming as many labyrinth as i can
since with a few judiciously placed waypoints they are a safe way of gathering rewards and traits
without having to make the elder and other questgivers into best friends.

This would allow me to pick a direction and settle in a settlement that's 100,
perhaps even 200 km away from relica within the first few weeks ingame. 

I'm still at ~10k points having played it like a turtle in order to research what the game
is like not. Its amazing that i survived this long, at least to me it is. If I ever hit 75k,
I could see having a good time with the commander since labys would help me level up any
crew in relative peace and quiet. A few legendary pieces of gear on me and an NPC, the
profits from a laby shared with him of course, have now let me conquer a brutal monster
in a den. Moving on and up in the equipment power, hopefully fully entering the steel and
later ages so i can move out and discover what's out there at the 200++ km horizon!


<a id="org9c881c5"></a>

## Trick out your map!

Use **/setlocalwaypoint** aka **/slw** at your spawn, at every house, donation
chest, and every last npc on the map. Greet NPC's and put their names into the
waypoint name. You'll be glad you did!

There are several buildings of which you'll want to expand at least the
warehouse within the first few weeks game-time. It offers a way to access quite
a bit of stuff from elsewhere. A local waypoint at the spawn and on the
warehouse donation chest will save you a lot of time.

"**W**" makes zooming around the local map quick and convenient. That is unless
there are doors, pets, npc, or even the well along the path. Its not perfect yet
but "**W**" is a huge help. Use **/slw** until it becomes a habit.


<a id="orgc710cd0"></a>

## Item Management

Where you keep your stuff is up to you!

But there's one thing you have to know: **WARNING** NEVER LEAVE ANYTHING ON THE
SPAWN tile! FARA's advanced teleportation mechanism creates an intense rush of
air as your body materializes &#x2013; and that scatters anything you might have left
there through the immediate area. Try it out.

Anyway, I'm still learning to play the game and I have yet to win. But this is
my second run at it in 3 years and I find that starting as a horder with a base
in Relica is again teaching me what I don't need or want, and how to deal with
everything else. Here's the scoop on what works for me.


<a id="org50cc659"></a>

### InShelter

1.  Latest

    Next game..  I'm working on plans to rework the warehouse based on where the
    door is in relationship to the spawn. I'll keep the donations box which you 
    later turn into upgraded storage free and clear with a /slw waypoint right next to
    it so i can use **/dropall** and/or **/ds** right there. 
    
    In the NW/NE I'm envisioning 9 storage chests each. a /slw in the center to 
    navigate, on the left the 3x3 design i've gotten used to, on the right,
    storages to hold whatever excesses so i have them close yet out of the way.
    
    i'd like to make the main entrance be north of the crucible with lights and
    so on. I'm not sure about where exactly to put a resting /slw nor about 
    exactly where to put the kitchen:
    
    -   5 fireplaces for the stat foods
    -   6 fireplaces for the elemental food
    -   foods and ingredients on the floor
    -   possibly no storages but put behind a door
        -   for easy dumping with /ds, splitting/pickups etc
    
    tbd. I'm now looking for a settlement some 300km from relica which i can stealth
    to in 2 hops without winding up in a lake.

2.  Update!

    After thriving for 132 days I'm ready to leave this layout behind.
    
    I worked beautifully. I used just two storages and was able to do get in 
    and out very quickly. But now that I **want** storages I'm make the warehouse
    into Pug's house and place 8 storages around the crucible. This frees up a
    workbench and allow the main problem with this layout &#x2013; the escortees that
    I wound up bringing into relica to no longer cramp my style. Mind you, they
    go their own way after you're not in town for a while, but its better this
    lest I give another precious item to them or the elder by accident.
    
    So as last night, this is the concept:
    
    <table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
    
    
    <colgroup>
    <col  class="org-left" />
    
    <col  class="org-left" />
    
    <col  class="org-left" />
    </colgroup>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td class="org-left">Woody</td>
    <td class="org-left">Clothy</td>
    <td class="org-left">Foody</td>
    </tr>
    
    
    <tr>
    <td class="org-left">Metally</td>
    <td class="org-left">**Crucible**</td>
    <td class="org-left">Tooly+</td>
    </tr>
    
    
    <tr>
    <td class="org-left">Undecided</td>
    <td class="org-left">Beddy</td>
    <td class="org-left">Runy</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
    -   Woody/Clothy/Metally play together really well because of the number of items
        that wind up in these storages.
    
    -   Foods has the Booze, Honey, Eggs, Meats, Venoms, Feathers, Nests and Beehives.
    -   Tooly all my "{<(Equipment)>}", all Shards, Medals, Lights, Lockpicks &
        Elemental Runes.
    -   Runy all the Effect and Stabilizer runes
    -   Beddy, a bed and useless flavor trinkets such as towel, blanket, pillow,
        a stuffed fuzzy doll, and all the Balls of wax and yarn a real hero needs.
    -   Undecided holds Gear and ammo for what will be my mercs. I'm still happy
        with my grizzly atm.
    
    This leaves huge piles of crystals & leather and the problem of cooked foods.
    
    I've not worked it out, but there will be 8 firepits and some kind of sensible
    way of dealing with buff/food preparation further south in the warehose.

3.  Initially

    I build a 7x7 house around the elder and the spawn point, so i'm close to my
    piles, quests and right next to a bed, a brazier and the door for the most
    restful healing sleep in every settlement I open.
    
    **THIS** is incredibly useful with local waypoints and I get a lot of mileage out
    of it! The base layout takes 23 planks, 4 braziers (8 rocks) and a door (2
    wooden blocks)
    
    In Relica I use this arrangement:
    
    <table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

    -   Under the Storage: Ammunition, Lockpicks, Ropes, Medals, Shards
    
    I have a /setkey for "/drop 8" and find using that and moving around quite effective
    to get the excess out of my inventory most of the time.

        This can be condensed quite a bit
        I'd say first of all that it should be simple things
        
        "Misc" "Materials" "Equipment" "Food" "Runes" "Valuable"
        
        That condenses Woody + Clothy + Metally and Buffy + Booze + Fruits + Seeds + Flowers
        
        Second of all, the brazier layout is bad (I think) because last I checked
        brazier light is blocked by item piles (which sucks)

### Warehousing

Unlock this Building ASAP!

"There is nothing in any of my warehouses .. except in Relica's." - pug.

First off, I don't really like the slow interaction with the storage bins in the
warehouse. 

Instead of holding an item-stack to put it into the the number 1 position and 
typing **/giveall**, I **/give #x** if its a single item and drop whatever stacked
item right on top of the bins.

I dont use scrolls but I keep them in a bin next to the crucible because I
already know that I will be desperate for them when I'm strong enough to get
myself into the best part of the game I know, dungeons! (Please don't read that
to mean that my avatar is mindless about hoarding. After all, some scrolls were
meant to be /salvaged and he's read enough of this guide to know that!)

Sure, as player, I could **/salvage** everything, but my avatar isn't wired like
that. He keeps fancy but not the fanciest kites, beehives, birds-nests, folded
notes, toyswords and other things like that for flavour. Once in the warehouse,
but these things are out of sight, not out of mind.

After opening up the (Refinery) I wound up with oddities like Tin Fiddles and
Organs, Bone Spears and Goggles. I love the recipes, but instead of salvaging
them right I stash away the Smith's output in the warehouse get an insight into
what he's doing, knowing full well that the stash doubles as a rune-shard hoard.

Ammo. I got tons of ammo of all kinds. When I get a new ranged weapon I try them out
and keep the nicest ones in a Storage box on which i all dump all spare ammo. I find
that much easier than placing stacks into the box.

But listen, before you stash anything you find or loot, beat-up and or salvage
the whatever because especially among the items you find on trees, surprises await!

1.  People who have seen more of the game know better things than dungeons!

    How cool is that?
    
    Check out this feedback: Dungeons! It's anything but "best"; It's an hour spent
    fumbling around in a dark maze trying to find a key and a door, dealing with
    stealthed enemies, and hidden traps! Dungeons are not the best part of the
    game. At all.
    
    To a long-time player of rogue-likes, that's an endorsement! and a promise for
    even better! <g>

2.  Thanks for paying attention!

    If you did, you will enjoy this random secret!
    
    -   Peacocks drop an item that gives you **FIN>>**
    -   Its kinda like the one with the milk :)

<a id="org6cfe42d"></a>

### In General

consider carrying 

-   a fruit to boost your stamina in an emergency.

-   a workbench to repair your party's gear.

-   consider carrying a rope or a kite whenever you take a shovel out for a dig
    to avoid getting hurt should the ground give way under your feet.

-   lights are useful to trigger encounters at night, insure that you the full
    attention of legendary beasts living in dens, lighting your way in that
    labyrinth you are too proud to exit, and for finding out "what's down there"
    when you eventually lie, legs broken, in that cave you dug into.

As with backups of your computer, there are two kinds of people in the world,
people who carry backups, and people who will.


<a id="org6d709b7"></a>

## Moving out and on

Again, complete the warehouse before you change settlements or do escort quests.
When you go take 2 medals and 10 ropes with you to quickly complete the
warehouse in your new place right away when you get there.

You'll also enjoy having spare a workbench, a bed and the materials you need for
the next house at the new locale's spawn already in the crucible.


<a id="org1bc3de9"></a>

## Upgrades

In each new settlement you reach you will find a set of tools to enhance your
equipment's performance.. Search for them and you shall find these craftable
gems.

But don't rush. Form a party, discover things and get settled and strong-ish.

After a while you and your party can handle all the kill quests the elder hands
out, and you'll likely have a couple of waypoints to other settlement and NPC's
eager to see you killed while you escort them there. When you are ready to look
for those tools and recipes accept the escort and delivery quests to that new
locale and leave right after waking up from resting.

Once you found them and are done marveling at your good luck from arriving
alive, getting a unique item and finding the tools, make sure to /inspect, not
/salvage them.

You can enhance the equipment of the proper type for your class which
you will have discovered, equipped and understood by now, or ..


<a id="org0d3f97d"></a>

### If you're totally nuts, enhance you shovel.

After settling into the the new place, find a beach and grind runes in style.

Plan to stay at the beach/dig-site for a while. Put up a 5x5 with door and
brazier for the good-morning buff and go rune hunting in safety close to
home.

When you can make a second workbench, then when you have runes for rejuvenation
and/or other spells go back to 'questing with the elder' until you have at least
several iron pieces or whatever is best for your needs.

Take your workbench when you dig so you dont need to make repair kits. Your
enhanced shovel will stay sharp that way. If you get bored digging, repeat the
racket with a fishing-rod while staying in the same shelter. Perhaps you'll even
put up a fire-pit for some extra 'positive outcome boosting' charisma buffing
snacks! Oh, and have a rope on you, just in case.

I've heard that noone will mind if you dig up a graveyard from end to end dolled
up in your finest charisma boosting gear either. But I'll let you try it first!
Maybe after your next escort quest?

Shovel or Fishing rod, what do i know. Plus I'm [dubious about iron](#orge9fdd59) as
a [material](#org129a58a) for either!


<a id="orgf17179f"></a>

### Fishing

I found a manual that tought me things about fishing. Then I made a great
chrystal rod, took my workbench to the ocean with me and experienced an entire
day passing without getting in the leastt bit tired, so great was the excitement
from pulling rune after rune out of the water.

Every other time since, no more than 2 or 3 runes for again spending an entire
day in the water.

Is this me; am i unlucky with the maps i picked? can i only have so much luck
per day ingame? All these are open questions, I'll try fishing again later and
see if my luck improves, after wearing out an entire workbench trying that's all
i can do.

For me fishing works best if i start by typing **/fish**, and then alternate
pressing "**f**" and "**z**", repairing the rod by right-clicking the workbench 
in between.


<a id="org12d585d"></a>

## Traveling

We all know your avatar's a bit sensitive and often drops down to the local
level because they sensed danger or spotted some cockroaches fight one another.

If the circle is blank of enemies, or you can make it so with a few steps away
from the fight, do that! more often than not "**X**" **/exit** or clicking on your
waypoint will take you out and put you back on the road!

And hey, if "**X**" fails, it will have moved you to the action without you having
to look for it. This is really helpful if you cast a shield on yourself before
doing do, esp. if your're traveling at night, yet again without a light.

As you're travelling you'll find more info about [Skill Brackets](#orgb876623). Please
share.


<a id="org0b83bc2"></a>

## Exploring

Soft Leather, Thick Padding Traveling Boots of Stealth?


<a id="org84b206b"></a>

### New Location?

I use this ~38 step pattern to explore new locations so that i see almost all
the map with little effort. Mobs and trees will change this a little bit, but
its good enough:

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Move</th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Until</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">SW x4</td>
<td class="org-left">SW border comes into view</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">NW x5</td>
<td class="org-left">LHS borders look the same</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">NE x10</td>
<td class="org-left">TOP borders look the same</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">SE x8</td>
<td class="org-left">RHS borders look the same</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">SW x10</td>
<td class="org-left">BTM  borders look the same</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Using the "**-**" view of the map is also really important to me because some of
the locations look great, and its good to know the lay of the land because 
sometimes I'll pick a different corner to go to first based on what I see

Keeping Relica as a base around which I explore at varying distances makes
investing into it viable and worthwhile. Thus I've painted up my map with paths
that let me see every time to do local quests for the NPC's quickly to efficiently
level up their loot drop, added lots of waypoints to get to all the places and people
without having to look where I'm going, and am now thinking seriously about just what
kind of storages to trick out my warehouse with.

People in the advanced stages of the game talk about traveling 1200++ km from
Relica, fighting unheard of monsters from unheard of dimensions while still
investing there. So that's good enough for me.

I don't know enough about the way the difficulty scales, but as I progress in
the game I'll be keeping an eye out for new locations, hoping I find something
that lets me have settlement hubs that are roughly a full day's travel from one
another as I expand.


<a id="orgd0c099c"></a>

### Your Stealth Potential

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to travel by stealth to and
from Relica by steps and by fast-travel in order to determine and confirm for
your self just how far away you can go before the safe-mode fast traveling or
exhaustion stops you from going any further.

Keep that distance in mind as you quest or explore and be careful! Don't just
try this using fast-travel to another settlement. You might drown yourself if
you do! 

For extra bonus see what stats might play a role in the completion of this
mission.

## Difficulty

FARA's difficulty is a gem. Yes, really. I don't know the formula, but like you,
I appreciate that the things you encounter in your travels seem to slowly get
harder. These things seem to matter:

-   the further from Relica you are,
-   the further away you have been,
-   the more challenging the enemies you have ended,
-   the better equipped/longer you have been in game,
-   the more titles (achievments?) you have.
-   WHAT ELSE?

But unlike most games, FARA doesn't actually seem to be out to kill you as it
did in (what to me were) 'the nightmare versions' released some years ago.

Combat in FARA can be freaky cool, and as long as you prioritize survival over
your macho, you'll manage to escape and appreciate the insurance that having a
piece of [fruit](#org5551c45), or a gulp of [[Bottles][water] with you for that one time where
its quicker to drink and hide thant to dash and walk. There's are always [surprises](#org0ea5890)!


<a id="org4a1a0d9"></a>

## Finding things in daylight vision

Update: The magic# for small items is four. Also zipping around the map with the
mouse is really fun now. Please keep these things in mind if/as you mark up your
map to insure that you really find everything like this. If you see that NPC's 
have moved about from where you last had them **/slw** waypointed, use the next item
find quest to update your waypoints and you'll not just find the balls of wax, but
the guy you need to give that nose-ring too with ease.

check how many spaces you can move without stopping when zipping around the map by 
placing a small item somewhere and counting. use one color for that.

npcs you can see at +- 10 range. use another color to mark all the places to click
and find everyone in town fast.

&#x2013;

Small things on the ground can be seen up to 5 spaces away in a straight line,
but only 3 spaces diagonally. This is true in town and in wilderness maps.

Thus if you're looking for flowers or lost items you can move in paralell lines
11 spaces apart, that means there are 10 spaces between your lines.


<a id="orgb47e516"></a>

### example in town:

1.  step 1

    move 5 right and down from the top left. there are now 5 spaces between you and
    the edge. use **/mark <color>** on a that square, then move all the way to the
    right until there are 5 spaces between you and the edge. use **/mark <color>**
    again and take 2 steps to the NE so you see into the very edges of the
    map. **/mark <color>** all those points 3 and 5 away from the map corners to
    remember.

2.  step 2

    from the top-left, on a marker with 5 spaces between you and the edges, move
    down until the marker just disappears and place another marker. repeat until
    you're at the bottom.

3.  step 3

    starting at your favorite marker in the top left corner, again mark spots with
    10 spaces between them going to the right.

4.  step 4

    now project the outside marks &#x2013; 5+1+10= &#x2013; to 16 spaces from the edges and you'll
    begin to see exactly where to place markers to make paths that guarantee search
    quest succeed quickly and consistenly.

5.  [step 5]

    when you walk around a new town for the first time setting up your **/slw** local
    waypoints, instead of only grabbing all the loot, place 4 markers inside the
    houses that leave 3 spaces between them and the walls. this makes it easy to
    remember that you only have to step on each of them once to have scanned
    everything. (you can can optimize that a bit, but this is good enough.)


<a id="org19241e1"></a>

## Climbing

I'm pre-repeating myself here so we are clear that **/climb** lets you ***dance***
on that table you just dragged to the middle of town. It's a good thing you
should use to get a view from the trees you **/harvest** and it might even let you
see a little further. But I don't think it helps you find small lost objects or
those hard to find small rare species you'll inevitably be tasked with
researching. Then again I'd not thought about planting trees in strategic
locations around town.. until now :)

## Combat

Seven7Eleven the Great, seemingly sole maintainer of the Wiki, recently has made
a good page on combat which i want to annotate some more:
<https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Combat_and_Tactics>


<a id="orgbae4618"></a>

## Laundry List

Thinking that the game's going to improve quite a lot more this year these are my little notes
about things i'll suggest or do something else with later on.

Random suggestions/notes/brainstorms/observations.

-   You know that brown bear that kept me company in the beginning? I probably
    mentioned him somewhere in these notes. One day he blocked a door and instead
    of pick-axeing my way out, i grabbed and dragged him back to the kennel, err,
    the farm. That was weeks ago and the poor guy is still freaked out, at least i
    keep seeing him dash about the map from time to time as i walk through
    town. He just adds a lot of flair that way. The cat and cat?  They are
    well. just a lot more sedate
-   One day i managed to travel to Relica from within Relica. I got to the top
    level map that way. But wouldnt it be nice if you could know that it would
    always take you to the local spawn point? Would save a local waypoint too.
-   Dragging something on a thing in a container to put it into the container!
    What could be better? Dragging something from the ground into a container by
    dragging in on a thing thats already in that container! Even better? Yes!
    Making that container the actively selected item because you just used it!
    Could work with opening and closing too. That would be like magic!
-   Locking items into my inventory so i could not salvage or drop or give them
    to anyone or otherwise misplace them. Being able to drop everything but the
    locked item.. being able to drop only all locked items. picking up all 
    previously locked items from the tile i'm standing on and equiping them,
    dropping a locked item into a pile on purpose and picking up it and any
    other locked items i had dropped into that spot. Bingo. Outfits. And not
    just for the beach! Anyway, once items are locked they show up in their
    own section, not more funny number please.
-   Renaming my storages, seing their names in the target list. and, uh, # as a
    prefix key for pressing #30 /take when i really just want to grab 30 ammo
    pieces. Psst. Using prefix keys! (imaging having more than one) to attribute
    or modify the action of the next command would be, like, really modern and
    keep the interface free of not so accessible things like Ctrl/Alt modifiers
    which people often seem to throw into their programs to confuse you.
    We all know what enter does, right? How about space as a prefix? And a take
    option on that use button. hah. then right cloud become predictable always!
-   So I have this storage with 51 crystal items made from sand i dug up the other
    day while hunting for runes. And I want to level up the recipes I've gotten
    since. So I screenshot whats in the box and compare it to my recipes list.
    You know what a drag that is? Its like my avatar has no way of remembering
    how many of what he's already made. Why are pen and paper for a log-book
    so hard to come by!? If I couldnt help him via the screenshots he'd still
    have a wooden shovel!
-   Recipes for items in storages
-   Quests could show the direction and distance to their location.
-   /salvage all == /salvageall => never salvages anything installed. even
    /salvage would ask you to confirm if you wanted to accidentally or not
    /salvage something on your person or installed. that's in a world where /craft
    /build and /install would work as one might imagine they would.
-   Popups comparing a found shield to my weapon instead of my shield. hmm.
-   Casting a spell on a party member; menu ought to include my class-specific buff!
-   When casting a buff that'i have running on a party member, lets put him first!
-   Perhaps no double saving while "Adventure saved!" is on the screen?
-   Pickup shields into offhand, at least if i just dropped it from there?
-   Refining items: candidates exclude the things meant held in inventory for my npcs
-   Manipulating party/npc items spells/items should not exit; also reenter with 'p'.

# Playing


<a id="org8664a13"></a>

## /COMMANDS

**If you find that your game slows down when moving around, issue /clearlog** 

-   **/help** gives most of them
-   **/settings** gives more of them
-   The [Release Notes](#org016b1bb) give insights into and context for additional commands.
    Click the link and search for "**/**"

The discord's spoiler channel denizens often refer to 'creative mode' and yet
more **/commands** but i haven't had the patience or desire to slug through the
jargon there. One seems to need to tap into the voice channel and speak to
people in order to obtain basic information about much of the game still.

If this bothers you as it does me .. because it keep out new players that will
give brian love and some money .. then **use this month of april'21** to send me
even just a single fact on the discord channel to add to this text before I'm
likely to fade into the void again!

-   **/split** operates on the selected item, give it a parm for how many items you
    want in a new pile

-   **If you happen to be on fire, (stop, drop and) /roll**


<a id="org8e2423e"></a>

## KEYS!

-   read the bottom of **/keybinds** aka "**K**"
-   use **Home/End** to scroll through help and other popup windows!
-   remember **/exit** aka "**X**" to leave a map.

    key.
-   you want autoloot off at home, so keep it off and use situationally.
-   climbing a tree before bumping into it occasionally gives kites, beehives,
    birds nests, maybe even a lost toy sword; all things you can drag home
    and exhibit to impress your npc buddies.

-   **z** is really cool for **/place** ing items into containers **/give** ing items and
    many more things. you can press it multiple times before the game reacts and
    it will do the right thing.

But, **be careful when using the /z shortcut!!!**

It repeats only most 'last typed (not shortcut) commands' which gives it the
ability to surprise you in unexpected ways!. If you're not sure what you typed
last, type / then press "up arrow". Not that that would save you from surprises
though.

## Talking

Unless you are a [Wildheart](#orgbb46f1f) you can talk to your pets and /say or /shout whatever
it is you want, and they won't listen. That is unless you are a [Cat Whisperer](#orgf4e2729) 
and have managed to recruit one of these marvels.

Normal people however can only talk to other people, and it's only the Mercs 
you've recruited into your party that will listen to and obey you.

-   use **/say wait here** and **/say follow me** to control your party members. you
    don't have to ask them to come along when you leave the map, they will do that
    by themselves.

-   Also:
    -   /say stow your X
    -   /say draw your X
    -   /say take that X
    -   /say stand by that X

-   An exclamation mark turns /say into /shout,
    -   example /say thief!

-   use **/shout come here** when searching for people.
    (repeat with "**z**" as you walk around.)

There's probably some (much?) more to say and other banter to be had. Many of
the options seem to make the most sense for a [Politician](#org66e634f) however.

Weird fact: Mercs and other NPC's sometimes say random things to one another!

## Caution!

The game, in alpha for many years now, and while holding the attention of a
loyal playerbase, has a developer's that stated expressly that he has no
interrest in maintaining save-game compatibility.

Thus you are advised to go through the trouble of downloading and
installing the game locally so that you will be able to finish games
in progress since using the web-version risks obliteration of your
save at any time!

Still..

*What little insight into this I have tells me that the danger*
*of this happening to you is diminishing with each new day.*

## Random Notes from Discord

-> PASTE NEW THINGS HERE

The first batch swiped 2021.04.06ish by scrolling backward in time a few months
is mostly distributed into this document already.

These I grabbed recently. Who knows how much more great insight and conversation
has been lost in the sands of time because.. documentation isnt spoilers, its
what lets other people have fun and what you'll want when you come back in a few
years. .. anyway ..

A few things regarding charged rift particles:

-   First, you can create one by dropping one of each elemental rune and making a spell. This still is very painful, but it won't destroy your stuff and doesn't require an inert rift shard.
-   Second, on one recent run I found a commoner with a quest to procure a "rift beacon." Turns out you build this using CRPs.
-   Apparently, they're able to summon Redeemed Rift Beasts which don't appear to be limited by the party size limit
-   Probably the stats of the Redeemed Rift beasts scale of distance away from relica
-   They seem to have a days survived stat that's always equal to yours, no matter when you summoned them.
-   I wonder where you could find the recipe for the RB
-   it's kind of busted for castle raiding
-   No idea. Might try feeding Relica's blacksmith until they hit on the recipe. That's how I got a gold ingot recipe.
-   Trader chests also sometimes come with recipes
-   Maybe take 3 CRPs to a Summoning Circle?

Blightwalkers only spawn if you have a blight

-   "It's form twitches sporadically, and you sense a strange affinity towards it"
-   oh I discovered how to find them
-   They spawn where you last died
-   Ent, but sergals are cheese — Yesterday at 5:39 PM
-   Interesting
-   mantecarl — Yesterday at 5:39 PM
-   My guess is that it's your previous body, or something?
-   Ent, but sergals are cheese — Yesterday at 5:39 PM
-   Life always comes at a cost, doesn't it?
-   mantecarl — Yesterday at 5:40 PM
-   also, the blightwalker has my previous weapon equipped
-   Ent, but sergals are cheese — Yesterday at 5:40 PM
-   Except Relica, apparently
-   And the tile next to Relica

I wonder if you can steal from them
Ent, but sergals are cheese — Yesterday at 5:49 PM
The dead have nothing to steal

Titles..

-   Mish]: Candance Darkshout the Scholar, Director of Shields recovered a Key Fragment! They only need 2 more fragments to complete the Astral Key.
-   Its from factions quests (from castles). I think you get one for completing three. I also got a key fragment with it.

&#x2013;

-   "You closely inspect your Forsaken Skull. Though void of eyes, you feel it still watches. It is small."
-   ent/ I literally suggested items that give passive buffs from being dropped on the ground, and one of them was the skull of a dungeon boss


<a id="org3215322"></a>

### what classes do yall like the most

*Ent, twice more* prefers

-   Pugilist > Viking > Soldier.

*Mantecarl* likes to say

-   For me, it's Swiftshade/Merchant.

*Mishaal* decided

-   Scholar's very versatile
-   I've only played with a limited number, but for me its the scholar!

and *Pug* survives

-   as a Gatekeeper.

## Obsolete/Guides


<a id="org9ab8458"></a>

### Degritone's Guide to 100k Points

Written by a master of the game for an old version, some relevancy remains
from: <https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Degritone%27s_Guide_to_100k_Points>

1.  Note

    This works best with **Pugilist**, **Viking**, or **Soldier**.
    
    Results may vary with other classes, and would not work for spell-based builds
    or Artificer. Additionally, this guide assumes you already know a little bit
    about FARA.

2.  Guide

    Get the quest to go to Relica and go, then immediately abandon any kill
    quests. Inspect then salvage every wooden object in Relica except the closest
    door to the elder. Take the glass mug. That house will be your home base. /craft
    workbench and drop it and all of your wooden blocks and hero medals in a corner
    of your house.
    
    Fill up your glass mug, sleep in your house (remember to close the door,) then
    do easy quests and waypoint anything you come across while traveling to look at
    monsters or find children. Also, salvage any equipment and runes you don’t care
    about and put the resources on your workbench pile. Repeat this until you find
    at least 2 fortresses.
    
    When you come across a **Will of the Wild Fortress**, interact with the officer and
    give them at least 10 medals. Interact with the Tactician and take the first 2
    minor traits on the list.
    
    Salvage all iron doors in every fortress you know of and hoard them on top of
    your workbench. Continue doing easy quests until you have some copper or better
    equipment, including a tower shield, and enough medals to make the total medals
    given to Will of the Wild 100.
    
    Go to the WotW Fortress with your medals and give them medals so you have max
    rep with them in the /factions screen. This should take 100 total medals,
    including the initial few you gave, though it will take more if you killed any
    WotW staff.
    
    Once you do that, take Analyzer (replacing the trait other than Plunderer) and
    inspect all your copper (or better) equipment. You can now make iron versions of
    that equipment. Do so.
    
    How many runic shards do you have right now? Is it less than 266? /craft
    dowel. /craft wooden shovel. /craft wooden repair kit. Find a beach. Dig (/dig)
    once on each tile, picking up every rune that spawns. With a wooden shovel, you
    can dig 16 times before you need to use your repair kit to fix your shovel. This
    number will be lower if you use a non-wooden repair kit to repair the shovel.
    
    If your shovel is orange, don’t dig again. If your wooden repair kit is broken,
    find a pile of clay and /craft clay repair kit. A clay repair kit will give you
    less digs per use, but is easy to produce.
    
    Repeat this until you have enough runes to salvage to get you to 266 runic
    shards, plus an additional Rune of Rejuvenation and Rune of Shields. Drop all
    the other runes in your inventory and use the salvage all command (usually the 7
    key, but may be a different key if you’re targeting something) until all the
    runes are shards. Take those shards back home to your huge pile of stuff.
    
    Make a Shield of Rejuvenation of a dual element of your choice (I recommend at
    least using water in the shield, however) by dropping the Rune of Shields, the
    Rune of Rejuvenation, and 2 elemental runes of your choice (and no other runes)
    on the same tile, then doing /makespell. Learn this spell.
    
    Go to the WotW Fortress and take the Fabricator trait, replacing Analyzer. Go
    back home and craft 7 Reinforced Tools and 7 Artisan tools. Use the Reinforced
    tools on your equipment, then go to the WotW Fortress once more and take the
    Forgemaster trait.
    
    Use your Artisan Tools on your equipment. Put water runes on three of your
    equipment and 2 of everything else on your equipment, excluding your weapon. You
    only put water on your weapon because it's healing every heavy attack. Putting
    any extra runes on the weapon would cause the healing to be every other heavy
    attack, effectively halving your healing.
    
    Finally, craft enough Sturdy Plates to get you to Godlike RES and slap those on
    pieces of your equipment that aren’t your weapon. Your weapon should have an
    Arcane Sigil, which must be found (Tool Chests are useful for this.) The
    remaining slots are your choice. FIN is useful for stealth, INS for lowering
    your Ward’s cost, STR for getting it to godlike, and CHA for increasing your
    Ward’s and Rejuvenation’s duration.
    
    Congratulations, you’re pretty close to immortal. Remember to use your Ward of
    Rejuvenation before starting a fight, rather than after, and to heavy attack
    twice when you’re able in order to heal. If you’re low on health, enter a safe
    location, use your Ward of Rejuvenation, and walk around until the rejuvenation
    wears off, then cast it again. Repeat until full health.
    
    The only things that can realistically threaten you are your own stupidity,
    Ruins if you aren’t careful, and potentially some spoiler monster. Though, this
    assumes you don’t walk too far from Relica. I haven’t seen what kind of damage
    output exists thousands of km away from Relica.
    
    So, go crazy (except around Ruins. Be careful there.) Kill whatever. You’ll get
    significantly more points if you get key fragments, so go get them. Castles are
    easy sources, since you can just kill all the guards in the noble’s room, then
    kill the noble for a fragment, then stealth away.
    
    Be sure to use any Obelisk Shards you get to upgrade your Shield of Rejuvenation
    to Flawless.
    
    Once you get the key, start eating fragments with /cast conversion. Only eat one
    at a time, and only after you get your 10th fragment. This maximizes points per
    fragment by making you get key completion points every time you get a
    fragment. Using conversions on godlike stats is wasteful, but otherwise, use
    them on whatever you want. It’s just a matter of time until you have 100k+
    points.

### Alpha 16 Mar'21..

1.  2021.04.24 0.0.16.5c Patch Notes

    -   Fixed some instances of incorrect item amounts displayed in the game log
    -   Fixed an issue with number keys not performing the expected action
    -   Fixed an issue with doors requiring expendable keys becoming re-locked once
        opened and closed
    -   Fixed several issues with lingering and/or incorrectly placed warning
        indicators on the minimap
    -   Fixed the Altruism trait not working as expected
    -   Fixed a few game crashes not tied to anything in particular
    -   Minor optimizations
    
    There are a few more bugs I'm aware of that need squashing, but I might not be
    able to get another patch out for a few days and didn't want to sit on these any
    longer.

2.  2021.04.16 0.0.16.5b Hotfix

    -   Fixed a game crash caused by certain quest turn-ins.

3.  2021.04.16 0.0.16.5 Patch Notes

    -   Started another pass on the scoring system. The most notable difference is
        that activities and feats are worth more the further from Relica you are.
    -   Started updating **/help** with some of the recently added commands. There are
        still quite a few missing.
    -   Added some Hot New Content at varying levels of completion
    -   Added a confirmation window for forgetting spells
    -   Added a few new quality of life commands:
        -   **/loglength (number)** which to control the number of older messages kept in
            the game log. The default is 50, and setting a lower value could improve
            game performance.
        -   **/sortcontainer** sorts the contents of a targeted container alphabetically.
        -   **/sortcontainers** sorts the contents of all containers on the map
            alphabetically.
        -   **/sorthere** sorts the contents of the tile where you stand alphabetically.
        -   **/sortall** executes all of the above sort commands in addition to **/sort** which
            sorts your inventory alphabetically. It should be noted that the target list
            will still prioritize distance over alphabetical sorting.
        -   **/dropsame** which will drop all items in your inventory that have a matching
            item on the same tile. If you are standing on an empty tile, this command
            will do nothing. Can also be done with **/ds** and **/dropalike**.
    -   Animals can now be tracked over water.
    -   Workbenches now repair party members items in addition to your own.
    -   Handing items to NPCs will now place the items in their inventories if their
        hands are full.
    -   Bumping into party members will now interrupt their action and cause them to
        switch places with you.
    -   Local waypoints now have letters which can be used to reference them in
        commands
    -   Number **keys 1-9 now execute** the corresponding entries when viewing **/spells** and
        **/waypoints**.
    -   Upon taking an item, the game will now attempt to target whatever new item is
        at the same index instead of resetting to the first item on the Nearby Targets
        list.
    -   Clicking party members on the **/party** window now brings up the same options as
        clicking them them on the Targets list
    -   Reordered some mouse menu items in order to lower the chances of accidentally
        performing some detrimental actions
    -   Fixed a bug with traders not working as intended
    -   Fixed a longstanding issue with autocomplete unexpectedly inserting undesired
        commands when typing quickly
    -   Fixed an issue with minions of NPC allies not properly re-partying with the
        NPC if the NPC was dismissed by the player
    -   Fixed a bug with the **/throw** command which often caused thrown items to hit the
        wrong target
    -   Fixed a crash caused by ascending staircases
    -   Fixed a bug which prevented Bleeding from working as intended on dashing and
        jumping entities
    -   Fixed a bug which allowed dashing while exhausted
    -   Fixed an issue with the **/approach** command not keeping the same target under
        certain circumstances
    -   Fixed an issue with certain NPCs having more weapons in their inventories than
        intended
    -   Fixed a few recipes with deprecated ingredients
    -   Mostly fixed the broken **/borderlesstiles** command
    -   Optimizations

4.  2021.04.01 Patch Notes

    -   The Distance Traveled stat is now based on your furthest distance traveled from Relica
    
    -   Fixed an issue with the 'Feed' menu option showing up for items it shouldn't
    
    -   Fixed an issue where the Open/Close menu options for certain storage containers was not working as intended

5.  2021.03.31 Patch Notes

    -   Added more details to the blight screen when applicable
    
    -   Added total number of slots to /inventory
    
    -   Reduced the contribution of discovered recipes to overall score
    
    -   Fixed a crash caused by clicking certain items while not having a target

6.  2021.03.30 Patch Notes

    -   Added an /exitgame command. This only works on the desktop version, and can also be found under Settings & Options when using the mouse. On the browser version, this will just trigger the /restart prompt.
    
    -   Fixed certain commands still working on the blight screen, causing the window to close and leaving players stuck in limbo until they restarted
    
    -   Fixed the comparison tooltip still showing up even if /tooltips were disabled
    
    -   Fixed an issue with curios not providing their recipes if immediately used from the ground
    
    -   Fixed an issue with yellow drag-and-drop indicators getting stuck onscreen
    
    -   Fixed an input related crash

7.  2021.03.26 Hotfix

    -   Fixed a bug which caused Illusionist's stealth effect to trigger on the attacker instead of the Illusionist

8.  2021.03.27 FARA Alpha 16: Blightborn is LIVE!

    Well met, travelers!
    Public Alpha 16 is here, and with it come some HUGE changes to the core mechanics of FARA. Combat and dying have been overhauled, and many other facets have been adjusted with the goals of encouraging exploration and smoothing game progression. I want to give a special thanks to the volunteers in our awesome Discord community for testing these changes over the last month. FARA is so much better because of your thoughtful feedback and gigantic brains. The notes presented below are but a fraction of what this update has to offer. FARA is a game about exploration after all, so I encourage you to start a new adventure and discover all the new goodies for yourself!
    
    1.  BLIGHTS:
    
        This update adds a little more flair to the concept of permadeath with the introduction of the Blight mechanic. Instead of immediately perishing when dealt a killing blow, you now have the option to be resurrected with a permanent difficulty modifier. These modifiers, or blights, range from stat reductions to increased encounter rate. You have the option to accept a blight every time you die, but the chances of successfully resurrecting are lowered based on the number of blights you have.
        
        As FARA grows in scope and presents new long-term progression options for players, the idea of permadeath as it existed seemed harsh and out of place. With the blight system, players should feel more empowered to explore and grow with the same character without the threat of their first mistake completely wiping out all of the time and resources they've invested in their worlds.
    
    2.  COMBAT:
    
        -   Variable speeds for most combat actions have been removed, making combat feel more turn-based. For every action you perform, all other combatants will also perform a single action.
        
        -   Added a /dash action. Dashing allows entities to move across multiple tiles in a single moment at the cost of stamina. Max dash distance is determined, among other factors, by Finesse. Dashing can also be performed by holding Shift and using the arrow keys. Releasing the Shift key will perform the dash.
        
        -   Added ~10 new unique heavy attack effects, including unique effects for Insight-based weapons
        
        -   Swapping two held items is now a free action which does not use a turn.
        
        -   Weapon size no longer plays a role in damage output or speed.
        
        -   Heavy attack stamina usage is now determined by the wielder's proficiency in the weapon's 'needed' stat.
        
        -   Reduced the duration of most effects, buffs, and debuffs by ~75%. Because of the changes to action speed, effects still expire at roughly the same point in a combat encounter.
        
        -   Most common damage-over-time effects now tick every moment instead of every ~5. Because of the duration reductions, they still deal about the same amount of total damage.
    
    3.  EXPLORATION & CRAFTING:
    
        -   Added some new items and NPCs in settlements to aid in resource management and exchanges
        
        -   Removed hunger and thirst
        
        -   Increased the likelihood of finding items and NPCs of interest when exploring local areas
        
        -   Reduced encounter chance when moving on the world map
        
        -   Common enemies now have a chance to drop crafting resources
        
        -   Increased starting inventory size from 20 to 25
        
        -   Increased Hidden Pocket inventory bonus from 2 to 5
        
        -   Simplified the crafting requirements of many weapons and tools
        
        -   Increased the material cost Workbenches and gave them the ability to repair all personal items at once
        
        -   Removed a big chunk of the starting recipes and dramatically increased the likelihood of finding items/recipes you don't have
    
    4.  CLASS CHANGES:
    
        -   Illusionist: Removed Blink spell and replaced it with Prestige, an ability which allows the caster and target to switch places
        
        -   Juggernaut: Their /dash causes damage to encountered obstacles
    
    5.  NEW LAYOUT OPTIONS:
    
        -   Added 2 new interface layout options which can be enabled with /layout2 (also known as /bigmap) and /layout3. They can be particularly helpful for those who wish the minimap was larger:
        
        Layout 1 (default):
        Layout2:
        Layout 3:
    
    6.  MISCELLANEOUS:
    
        -   Made some substantial engine optimizations. The game should run much, much better in crowded environments.
        
        -   Mouseover tooltips can now be disabled with /tooltips.
        
        -   Arcane Obelisks in settlements now have infinite uses.
        
        -   Autoloot is now enabled by default. If you've played FARA before, you might need to manually turn this setting on with /autoloot, or via the /settings menu.
        
        -   FINALLY updated some of the outdated information under /help and /define
        
        -   Fixed a crash caused by butchering fish
        
        -   Fixed an issue with blight spells (now called plagues) lasting forever
        
        -   Fixed a crash caused by /define
        
        -   Fixed all sorts of typos
        
        -   Added new typos
        
        As is the case with every update regardless of size, starting up a new adventure is strongly recommended over trying to load an older save. In this case, trying to load anything older than 0.0.16 won't even work.
        
        Good luck out there, travelers!

### Alpha 15 Dec'20..

Don't miss the Author's [addtl notes for this version](http://playfara.com/2020changelog.txt)!

1.  2021.02.13 Patch Notes

    -   Removed several unfinished settlement facilities. They will make a return when they actually do something. For now, every settlement has the same 5 facilities, and they are always in the same style of building.
    -   Finished the Warehouse facility
    -   Added a /recipe 'itemname' command which lists the components of a specified known recipe. Can also be performed with /rcp.
    -   Added a /deletetitle command for permanently removing earned titles from the /factions window
    -   Added 'Repair' as a mouse menu option when possible
    -   Updated castle Nobles to fall more in line with the quest behavior of settlement Elders. One notable difference is that the completion or failure of noble quests will affect faction reputation. For now, the quest types are the same ones you know and love, with the goal of having faction-specific quest types in the future.
    -   Inspecting bags now unlocks recipes for the next size/type of bag.
    -   The /repair command can now utilize Repair Kits on the ground as long as they're within reach.
    -   Made unknown landmarks more obvious when traversing the world map
    -   If you've been having input issues and have a game controller connected to your computer, you may now use /ignorecontrollers to (hopefully) fix any problems.
    -   Typing '/inspect all' will now inspect all items on your target list. Each inspection still counts as a complete action, and the sequence will be interrupted if you take damage.
    -   Updated the criteria for which character deaths/retirements are announced on Discord
    -   The character sheet now properly shows attunements after death
    -   Fixed a long-standing issue with NPCs taking 1 more moment than the player to perform any action. The fix for the this was suspiciously easy, so I'm positive I've broken something. Let me know what you find!
    -   Fixed a bug which prevented Traders from working as intended
    -   Fixed a bug which prevented the /autosave setting from persisting after reload. Note, this is different from the forced saves that take place after certain game events. Forced saves cannot be disabled.

    -   Fixed several instances of map cursors lingering longer than they should
    -   Fixed an issue which prevented the manifestation of a second minor trait if you had a major trait
    -   Fixed an issue with cavern entities such as chests and nodes crowding the cavern entrance instead of being spread throughout the cavern.

    -   Fixed an issue with certain entities not showing up on the target list at the proper distances

    -   Added a /repair command which will use a Repair Kit on a specified item

4.  2021.02.06 Patch Notes

    -   Added a /bigmap layout, which shifts some interface elements around to accommodate a much larger, centralized mini(?)map. Enabling this layout will also trigger some other interface changes which can be controlled individually:
        -   /reverselog which switches the direction and order of game log messages. The most recent event will be at the top.
        -   /objectivewindow which is a new window in the upper left for tracking active quests

    -   Fixed an issue which caused the Attack Confirmation dialogue to pop up when attacking corpses
    -   Fixed a pretty massive oversight with how stats were calculated under certain conditions

    -   Lowered the amount of stamina spent when pushing large objects
    -   Charm and material quality now play bigger roles in succesfully befriending and taming animals

    -   Butchering expedition quest monsters now counts as quest completion.
    -   Fixed an issue with the indoor spaces of island buildings acting like water instead of land

    -   Fixed a bug which could cause NPCs to swap their weapons back and forth if they spawned with a shield in their main hand

    -   Reworked the way multi-element damage is applied to fix edge cases where the game log produced duplicative messages
    -   Fixed a bug where controls could become unresponsive if a keyboard command caused the game window to lose focus

    -   Typos

14. 2021.01.21 Patch Notes

    -   The Dazed effect now increases damage taken in addition to lowering Strength and Insight.
    -   Rebalanced weapon damage calculations to make larger, slower melee weapons more viable
    -   Reworked Jesters: "Jesters are immune to stumbling after missed heavy attacks, instead gaining Opportunity which refunds the stamina cost of their next action. Additionally, dancing uses less stamina and restores mood and stamina to party members."
    -   Elemancers can now pull elements from various effects afflicting their target, such as gaining fire attunement from burning entities.
    -   Added /listexits command which details the distance and direction of the closest exit to leave a local map

    Split /approach and /goto into separate commands. /approach is now specifically for walking up to targets, and /goto is for walking to locations.
    
    -   Added partial matching to /goto command. i.e. '/goto 1' will take you to 'Local Waypoint 1' if there isn't a direct match.
    -   Fixed a TTS issue which prevented readouts following the /say command

26. 2020.12.30 Hotfix

    -   Fixed some inconsistent behavior with the /approach command

27. 2020.12.30 Patch Notes

    -   Added a local waypointing system:
        -   /setlocalwaypoint 'name' creates waypoints on local maps. Can also be done with /slw.
        -   /clearlocalwaypoint 'name' clears them. Can also be done with /clw.
        -   /goto 'name' or /approach 'name' will attempt to pathfind to the local waypoint.
        -   All of these functions can also be accessed via the mouse menu under Manage Waypoints or on the /waypoints window.
    -   Added some mechanical differences between /eat and /drink. The most notable benefit of this change is that eating waterskins by accident is a little harder.
    -   Added a few more consequences for negative faction reputation
    -   Added a few new Runes
    -   Removed Rune of Truesight. It was way too strong.
    -   Adjusted Mortician: Increased stat bonus at night and removed night vision bonus
    -   Manually entering a local area now has a chance to trigger encounters and reveal you, even if stealthed. The chances to trigger encounters and subsequently be revealed are separate and determined by Finesse. Classes with at least moderate Finesse should notice little difference.
    -   Players are no longer locked out of building reputation with opposing factions when choosing to help one.
    -   When /highdetail is enabled, moving to a target or area with /approach will describe the direction and distance of targets visible from your new location.
    -   /highdetail no longer logs the movements of mounts and party members.
    -   Eating meals now takes longer than before and restores a flat percentage of health instead of providing Rejuvenation.
    -   Building entrances in settlements now always face south because of lore and definitely not for any other reason.
    -   Fixed a crash caused by TTS
    -   Potentially fixed a crash caused by abandoning quests
    -   More crash fixes
    -   Typos
    
    This patch will absolutely break existing saves. A new start is always recommended.

    -   Fixed a bug which prevented the Hunting Lodge NPC from working as intended

31. 2020.12.11 After 568 Days, Public Alpha 15 is LIVE!

    Long time no see, travelers!
    
    It's been 568 days since FARA's last public update, but that isn't to say the
    project has been dormant. A dedicated, intrepid group of adventurers has been
    testing a rebuilt version of the game since July, and that test-of-a-test is now
    ready for everyone to&#x2026; test. There have been well over 120 patches in that
    time, and what's listed below is a summary of the highlights. If by chance you
    want to read every raw, potentially spoilery, nitty gritty detail without much
    context, you can find 
    
    **the full 1,300+ line changelog here:**
    
    -   <http://playfara.com/2020changelog.txt>.
    
    I want to give my most heartfelt thanks to everyone invited to test the changes
    over the last few months. You could have spent that time and energy on anything,
    and the fact you chose to help make FARA a better game means the world to me.
    
    If you haven't already, join us on Discord!
    
    1.  SUMMARY:
    
        -   The biggest goal of this update was to re-write many of FARA's underlying systems and data structures. In doing so, the game should run faster and scale better with future development. There are also a TON of bug fixes, gameplay changes, and usability improvements. If you've tried FARA in the past and spent more time fighting the interface than monsters, I encourage you to give this new build a shot.
    
    2.  INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS:
    
        -   You can now hold down the arrow keys to continuously move in a direction. Additionally, you can click and drag from the center of the screen to activate a virtual joystick and move around.
        
        -   There is now an interact button in the target window which can either be clicked to perform the displayed action, or at least inform you of what action pressing [ Enter ] will perform.
        
        -   Right-clicking in the center of the screen now presents the same target options as clicking on the target window. Holding the right mouse button down while scrolling the mouse wheel will cycle through targets.
        
        -   Hovering the mouse over objects on the map will display what they are, and clicking an object will target it and bring up a list of options.
        
        -   Added more bump-to-interact options. Bumping into foliage will harvest it, bumping into large ore nodes will attempt to mine them, bumping into non-hostile NPCs will /interact with them.
        
        -   Added drag and drop! Dragging objects from the Nearby Targets window and dropping them on your inventory or the game log will attempt to /take them. Dragging items in your possession and releasing them on the game log will /drop them. Dragging items in your possession and releasing them on your target will attempt to /give the item. You can also drag items between your holding, wearing, and inventory windows.
        
        -   Added tooltips! You can now hover your cursor over most objects and targets to learn about them.
        
        -   Added animations! Several (mostly combat-related) actions now have animated effects which will play over the target window or the center of the screen.
        
        -   Added a new interface for building structures. Press [ b ] or type /build with Wooden Blocks near by to create buildings one room at a time instead of tile by tile.
        
        -   The health and stamina bars are now displayed by default.
        
        -   All of the most frequently used pop-up windows (/character, /spells, /recipes, etc) now have tabs along the top, allowing quick access to the other frequently viewed windows. Continuously pressing [ c ] will cycle through all of the windows.
        
        -   Clicking on party members now displays options to view their stats, items, and spells.
        
        -   Pressing [ - ] now opens a window which shows the entire local map. If you are in a dungeon or somewhere similar, this map will only show areas you have seen. This feature can also be accessed by clicking the header of the minimap or typing /map.
    
    3.  GAMEPLAY CHANGES:
    
        -   There is now a static settlement named Relica near the start of an adventure. The further you travel from Relica, the more difficult (and rewarding) the game becomes. There are still randomly generated settlements, but they are few and far between.
        
        -   Added fast travel, accessed by either clicking a waypoint or typing /travel (waypoint number). If you are tracking a waypoint, you can also click on the compass.
        
        -   Most randomness has been removed from combat. There are no longer chances to miss or crit - both will happen consistently when the right conditions are met. Elemental weapons will always trigger their effects with heavy attacks and never on regular attacks. Elemental spells will always trigger their effects with every cast.
        
        -   Jumping while targeted by an attack will cause you to dodge the attack. In the case of a spell, you will take half the spell's normal damage and avoid any secondary effects.
        
        -   Ranged weapon attacks now has a reload penalty which adds time to your next action
        
        -   Stamina now regenerates over time, and is more of a per-encounter resource than a per-rest resource. Heavy attacks and jumping/dodging use considerably more stamina than before.
        
        -   The gap between the lowest and highest health classes has been narrowed. Classes now either have slightly below average health, average, or slightly about average health.
        
        -   Most of the primary stats have been renamed, and their purposes tweaked:
            -   Strength: Increases damage dealt with melee weapons and unarmed strikes, decreases stamina spent pushing large objects
            -   Finesse: Increases damage dealt with ranged weapons, increases chance to disarm traps, increases stealth ability, decreases reload time of ranged weapons, decreases stamina use of jumping and stealth
            -   Resilience: Reduces physical damage taken, reduces duration of negative effects, increases stamina regeneration rate
            -   Insight: Increases damage of spells, increases search ability, decreases stamina cost of spells
            -   Charm: Increases the duration of positive effects, increases odds of favorable outcomes
        -   Wisdom has been removed
        
        -   Added equipment slots - Head, Body, Hands, Feet, and Accessory. Typical equipment will fit into one of the slots. The accessory slot retains the old behavior of allowing anything\* to be equipped there.
        
        -   Added a trait system. Traits add passive bonuses and features to your character. There are 3 types - Master, Major, and Minor. Master traits are determined by your class and cannot be changed. Major and Minor traits can be acquired from different factions as rewards for helping them. You can have 1 Major trait and 2 Minor traits.
        
        -   Added several new enemies, encounter types and scenarios
        
        -   Dungeons have been reworked to produce more interesting layouts, and new kinds of obstacles have been added
        
        -   Randomly generated factions have been removed in favor of 3 static factions - the Radiant Hand, the Jade Circle, and the Wild of the Wild. There is a lot in store for the faction system, but for now, they serve as the primary means of acquiring traits.
        
        -   World biome distribution is far more logical and aesthetically pleasing than before.
        
        -   Meals are now stackable, provide rejuvenation, and only use a single ingredient. Cooking multiple items on a fire will produce multiple meals.
        
        -   Crafting materials have been rebalanced across the board. A handful have been removed, and several new ones have been added.
        
        -   You can no longer craft unknown objects for twice the material cost. Instead, inspecting an item will teach several related recipes.
        
        -   The default maximum party size has been reduced from 4 to 2.
    
    4.  CLASS CHANGES:
    
        Blacksmith, Brewmaster, Tailor, Spelunker, Constable, Astronomer, and Yogi have been removed. Their abilities and features have been added to other classes.
        
        -   Added Mortician! Ability: Undertaking: Morticians have access to the Fervent Embalming spell which raises corpses to fight for a short duration. Additionally, Morticians do not attract hostile targets when resting outdoors, and gain a bonus to all stats and vision at night.
        
        -   Added Peasant! Peasants have terrible stats across the board and can't use magic. If you wanted FARA to be more challenging, here's your Expert Mode.

        -   Duelist has been reworked: "Duelists gain Opportunity after perfectly timed dodges, allowing their next action to be performed without using stamina. They also have the En Garde ability which increases the Duelist's damage against a selected target while amplifying damage the Duelists receives from other sources."
        
        -   Executioner has been reworked: "Executioner's killing blows deal splash damage and knock adjacent targets to the ground. They also have the Last Word ability which deals heavy damage to targets who are Dying."
        
        -   Juggernaut has been reworked: "Juggernauts are immune to immobilization and force spells, deal twice as much damage to non-sentient objects, knock down hostile targets after jumping, and can smash through most doors."
        
        -   Gatekeeper has been reworked: "Gatekeepers will deflect long-range projectiles, and their shields and armor take less damage in combat. They also have the Protect ability which temporarily reduces the amount of damage a target takes by half."
        
        -   Soldier has been reworked: "Soldiers gain increased damage resistance as their health decreases."
        
        -   Kung Fu Master has been reworked: "Standard attacks trigger Bear Stance, causing thier next heavy attack to inflict Dazing. Heavy attacks trigger Monkey Stance, causing thier next jump to grant Quickness. Jumping triggers Tiger Stance, causing their next standard attack to inflict bleeding."
        
        -   Fishmonger has been reworked: "Fishmongers cannot drown, take greatly reduced damage while Intoxicated and are immune to the negative effects, and have a higher chance to catch rare items while fishing."
        
        -   Elemancer has been reworked: "Elemancers have a bonus to all elemental attunements. They also have the Attune ability which channels the elemental energy of a target to boost the caster's relative attunement. Successfully casting the ability a second time will combine the elements, providing two boosts at half the potency. Attunements are lost after rest."
        
        -   Scholar has been reworked: "Scholars gain Enlightenment after conversing with someone or learning a new recipe, temporarily increasing their insight. Scholars can cast spells from scrolls at higher tiers based on their insight, and can use the same scroll several times."
        
        -   Gamber has been reworked: "Gamblers have access to the 'Gamble' ability which inflicts a random negative condition to either the caster or their target. Charm reduces the stamina cost of this ability and increases the likelihood of afflicting the target over the caster. When used on certain chests, Gamble will either upgrade the quality of the chest or completely destroy it."
        
        -   Ragamuffin has been reworked: "Ragamuffins have an increased chance to steal successfully, and can find a wider variety of items. In combat, Ragamuffins can attempt to /steal weapons used to attack them."
        
        -   Kunoichi has been reworked: "When attacking from stealth, Kunoichi deal bonus damage and remain hidden if the attack kills their target. Additionally, Kunoichi recover from the Revealed effect twice as quickly, and gain Quickness when Revealed."
        
        -   Gamestalker has been reworked: "Gamestalkers immobilize targets when attacking from stealth at range."

        -   Bodybuilders have been reworked: "Bodybuilders have access to the Flex ability which will blind a hostile target. If completely unarmored, Flex will also provide a temporary Charm bonus and cleanse negative status effects."

        -   Rift Dancer has been reworked: "A Rift Dancer's heavy attacks and spells summon creatures from other planes."
        
        Saying there is more to the update than what is listed above would be the understatement of a lifetime. While I could have gone into greater detail, let's not forget that FARA is a game about exploration and discovery. Adventure awaits!

32. 2020.12.10 FARA's Getting an Update Tomorrow!

    Hello, travelers!
    
    Tomorrow, FARA will get its first update since May 22, 2019! The official changelog will be posted shortly before the update goes live at 9pm EST, and it's a beefy one. It should be noted that old saves can't run in this new version, so if you're playing in the browser and have a run in progress, but sure to end it as gloriously as possible before then.

2.  2019.05.20 Patch Notes

    The first public alpha for FARA was released one year ago today! I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who's taken the time to try FARA out and provide feedback. This game wouldn't be even half of what it is today were it not for the enthusiastic, welcoming, and dedicated community which has built up over the last year. I've wanted to be a game dev since I was a kid, and the FARA community has made that dream more fulfilling than I ever thought possible. You all have been incredible, and I look forward to the continued discourse that has shaped the game into something so many people find enjoyable. Now, let's celebrate the occasion by making the game way harder:
    
    -   Key Fragments no longer resurrect the player when killed.
    -   Added a new innate spell to the player character - Astral Blessing. This ability expends ALL collected Key Fragments to completely restore health, stamina, and mood. Astral Blessing also bestows several positive effects for a moderate duration, removes all hunger and thirst, and damages nearby enemies.
    -   Started working on some public leaderboard stuff. When a character of notable achievement dies, retires, slays a dungeon boss, or completes the Astral Key, an announcement will be made in the FARA Discord (<https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn>). You can set a username ingame with /setusername yourname. You can opt out of this feature with /eventsharing.
    -   Increased the importance of dexterity for reliably hitting targets with ranged weapons
    -   Removed the strength bonus from ranged weapon damage
    -   Made some changes to the start of the game
    -   Removed wooden planks from the game and adjusted crafting recipes for objects which used them
    -   Individual keybindings can now be reset with '/setkey keytochange default'
    -   Made an adjustment which should make it a little easier to build shelters when you have allies following you
    -   Typing /define without specifying any text wil now show all glossary entries.
    -   Non-sentient entities can no longer be knocked prone.
    -   Fixed several broken commands issued via mouse menu
    -   Fixed an issue which prevented the [ z ] key from being re-bound
    -   Fixed an issue which allowed certain monster abilities to work on slain entities
    -   Fixed a bug that allowed traps be salvaged with /salvageall.
    -   Fixed (more) issues with the Pounce ability
    -   Fixed an edge case with Elder riddles which allowed duplicates of certain answers
    -   Fixed a crash caused by entering castles
    
    A fresh game is required in order to continue regular play.

6.  2019.05.13 Patch Notes

8.  2019.05.11 Patch Notes

    -   Added a new class, the Bloodweaver! Unique Ability: Hemophiliancy - Bloodweavers have access to the Blood Pact spell which places a Sigil of Blood on a target. This sigil slowly grows in potency over time, dealing increased damage while increasing the power of the target. Casting Blood Pact on a target affected by Sigil of Blood will transfer the sigil to the caster while retaining its potency level. Casting Blood Pact on target while affected by Sigil of Blood will transfer the existing sigil to the target. Only one Sigil of Blood may be active at a time.
    -   Reworked Beekeeper. Unique Ability: Hiveminded - When Beekeepers interact with beehives, they become swarmed by a mass of bees which they can command using the Send Bees and Call Bees abilities. Beehives of different materials produce different kinds of swarms. Beekeepers have no additional materials cost for building unknown hive types, and are immune to the negative effects of swarms.
    -   Made some adjustments to the Elemancer class:
        -   Reduced health to Below Average
        -   The trigger chance for elements on their armor is now based on the quality of the armor
    -   Reduced the size/weight of common fruits and vegetables
    -   Reduced the material cost of shelters

    -   Travelling unstealthed in the overworld no longer uses stamina. Traveling stealthed uses stamina and takes twice as long.
    -   Increased the rate at which hunger and thirst build while travelling the overworld
    -   Reworked animal mounting. Potential mounts must now be tamed with a saddle before they can be ridden. The quality of the saddle as well as several other factors determine the likelihood of successfully taming an animal. Equestrians get a bonus to tame attempts.- Entities now also have a chance to be knocked from their mount when struck.
    -   Entities can no longer trigger elemental effects via self-targeted skills and abilities.
    -   Fixed a bug which prevented the Quests & Reputation menu option from displaying correctly
    -   Fixed a bug which caused the bleeding effects caused by Pit Fighters to last longer than intended

9.  2019.05.10 Patch Notes

    This build contains critical bug fixes, and updating is strongly recommended.

    -   Changed the formula for calculating hit chance with ranged weapons. Ranged attacks are less accurate the further they travel, and this penalty is lessened by Dexterity.
    -   Plural names are now acceptable command arguments (i.e. '/take daffodils' should work, when before you needed to type '/take daffodil' even if there were multiple)

    -   Further increased the amount of physical attack damage added by strength
    -   Adjusted Attack Power descriptions to better reflect damage values in the game. The underlying damage values have not been changed.

    -   Fixed a bug where the wrong attack speed calculation could be used
    -   Fixed a bug that caused plummeting into caverns to cause more damage than intended

15. 2019.05.01 Public Alpha 14 is LIVE - Perfectly balanced\*, as all things should be.

    NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 14:
    
    -   All items and materials have had their stats rebalanced, and 4 new materials have been added. Generally speaking, achieving extremely high stats takes more planning than before, and fights should last a little longer with (slightly) fewer unexpected damage spikes.
    -   The dexterity stat has been completely reworked, and with it comes a few changes to combat:
        -   The dodge chance provided by dexterity now only applies when moving or jumping. This means that in order to be successful with a dexterous character, you actually need to move around as you fight.
        -   Dexterity now reduces the stamina cost of jumping, and the cost of jumping has been slightly increased.
        -   High dexterity is now critical for reliably disarming traps and using stealth
        -   The "enemy blocked your movement even though you weren't going that way" mechanic has been removed.
    -   Charisma now increases the duration of positive effects in addition to reducing the duration of negative ones.
    -   Intelligence now reduces the cost of most spells instead of Wisdom
    -   Constitution and Wisdom are now more effective at reducing physical and elemental damage respectively.
    -   Added a new item type: Reinforcements. Reinforcements can be added to other items to increase certain stats or grant advantages to certain actions.
    -   Added a message grouping setting which consolidates repeated messages into a single line. It is on by default, and can be toggled with /messagegrouping.
    -   Added speed information to attack messages
    -   Added [ ? ] as a hard-coded shortcut to open /help
    -   Added several new encounter types and revamped the Caravan encounter
    -   Added 2 new weapon types
    -   Revamped the /inventory command to show a detailed list of all your possessions. The default shortcut is [ shift + i ].
    -   Reworked the /accomplishments screen to provide a little more detail about your deeds, and expanded it beyond quest completions. Entries will also be generated for title acquisitions, defeating legendary beasts, etc.
    -   Pigments and Scribe Chests have been removed from the game, and instead areas can be marked freely with the new /mark (color) command. Areas can be cleaned with /clearmark.
    -   Fleshed out the noise system a bit. If something is moving nearby and you can't see it, you might still hear it.
    -   Allies can now be instructed to ride animals
    -   The darkness effect now increases the mood of the attacker in addition to draining the mood of the target
    -   Increased the amount of stamina gained from the Soul effect

    -   Reduced the base duration of Elemental summons
    -   Reduced damage taken by armor and added variance based on the type of attack used against it.
    -   Fleeing local areas now restores health and stamina to any hostile pursuers.
    -   Crafting Repair Kits now makes five at a time, and Repair Kits now only work on items of the same material
    -   Active traps must now be disabled before they can be salvaged.
    -   Fixed a bug that caused innate spells to cost less stamina than intended
    -   Fixed a bug which could prevent spells from having reduced stamina costs
    -   Fixed a bug which prevented mouse menus from working if Quick Actions were disabled
    -   Fixed a crash caused by bags
    -   Fixed an issue where players could get trapped in Legendary Beast dens
    -   Fixed a bug which allowed the /connect command to be used on anything
    -   Updated several /help and /define entries
    
    1.  CLASS CHANGES:
    
        -   Pit Fighter: When critically hit, Pit Fighters gain the Payback effect, which grants bonus damage to their next attack based on the amount of damage received.
        -   Gamestalker: Gamestalkers now deal more damage the farther away their target is, and their accuracy trait has been removed
        -   Juggernaut: The knockdown effect of the Juggernaut's movement now interrupts the actions of those affected.
        -   Demon Slayer: Demon Slayers now silence the source of elemental damage they resist.
        -   Gatekeeper: Stamina cost of the Protect ability is now determined by Constitution
        -   Kensai: Stamina cost of the Samurai Showdown ability is now determined by Dexterity
        -   Gambler: Stamina cost of the Gamble ability is now determined by Charisma
        -   Rhapsodist: Fixed the class not actually working at all
    
    2.  HIGHLIGHTS SINCE PUBLIC ALPHA 0.0.13.0:
    
        -   Added class-specific NPC behaviors for Botanist, Alchemist, and Chefs
        -   Added different heavy attack effects for the various firearms:
            -   Hand Cannons retain the old trait of interrupting targets
            -   Rifle damage is now based on distance to the target, with further targets taking more damage
            -   Blunderbusses now deal damage to every piece of armor a target is wearing
            -   Cannons now deal splash damage to objects adjacent to the target
        -   Added two new quest types
        -   Reworked Kensai. Unique Ability: Samurai Showdown - Kensais have access to the Samurai Showdown ability which dashes to a targeted area at imperceivable speeds. Enemies along the path receive the [Already Dead] effect which deals damage after a brief delay and grants fury to the Kensai. The damage and fury duration are determined by the number of enemies hit.
        -   You can now tell party members to be/not be passive. While passive, party members will still defend themselves and their allies, but will not immediately attack anything you attack.
        -   Added several more /say commands for managing same-species party members including:
            -   /say stow your X
            -   /say draw your X
            -   /say take that X
            -   /say stand by that X
        
        As is usually required when there's a big update\*\*,
        a fresh game is required for everything to work properly,
        and the game probably won't start at all if you attempt to load an older save.
        
        Also, if you haven't joined us on Discord yet,
        drop by and make some friends! <https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn>
        
        .\* Highly debatable.
        .\*\* Any update

Enemies along the path receive the [Already Dead] effect which deals damage after a brief delay and grants fury to the Kensai. The damage and fury duration are determined by the number of enemies hit.
    -   You can now tell party members to be/not be passive. While passive, party members will still defend themselves and their allies, but will not immediately attack anything you attack.

5.  2019.04.01 Public Alpha 13 is LIVE - Combat: Evolved

    1.  NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 13:
    
        -   This alpha release overhauls FARA's oldest, and quite frankly, most confusing system - combat:
            -   Offensive attacks, defensive attacks, evasive attacks, balanced attacks, pushing, kicking, and parries have been removed in favor of just two attacks: Regular attacks ([ a ] or /attack) and Heavy attacks ([ shift + a ] or /attackheavy).
            -   Regular attacks behave mostly like Balanced attacks from pre Alpha 13.
            -   Heavy attacks tend to be slower, more powerful, use stamina, decrease weapon durability, and trigger special effects based on the weapon used. For instance, performing a heavy attack with a dagger or similar small blade will cause the attacker to leap backward evasively after the strike. Other heavy attacks can deflect projectiles, apply status effects, etc.
            -   Entities gain most of the benefits provided by the removed Defensive/Evasive stances as long as they can see the attacker and are not performing any actions (including attacking)
        -   Added class-specific combat behaviors for NPCs. Gunslingers will jumping around to dodge ranged attacks, Alchemists will throw mixtures, etc.
        -   Added ~10 new weapon types
        -   Rebalanced the stats for several material and item types
        -   Entities no longer need a target selected to attack. Attacking without a target will now just attack in the direction you are facing.
        -   Made several changes to the stealth mechanic to award those who properly prepare for the occasion
        -   Elemental Resistance has been changed to Elemental Attunement.  In addition to granting resistances, attunement also increases the potency of one's triggered elemental effects
        -   Health and stamina bars now show the last instance of damage in a slightly faded color
        -   Increased inventory capacity from 20 to 25
        -   Reduced the damage of most melee weapons
        -   Combative NPCs will now investigate strange noises they hear from unseen entities
        -   Changed the Intoxicated condition - it now reduces attack accuracy while increasing charisma, constitution, and the chance to stumble after missing.
    
    2.  CLASS CHANGES:
    
        -   Gatekeeper - Reworked their unique ability: "Gatekeepers have a higher than usual chance to deflect projectiles and block moving enemies attempting to flee. Additionally, their shields and armor take less damage when struck."
        -   Elemancer - They now received a bonus to all elemental attunements
        -   Dervish - Whirling now prevents Dervishes from being interrupted by attacks
        -   Rhapsodist - Their songs now require four notes and are a combination of heavy and regular attacks
        -   Monk - Path of Fire now triggers for entities in tiles adjacent to the jump path
        -   Demon Slayer - They now have a chance to resist damage from Legendary Monsters
        -   Potter - Fixed several issues which prevented the class from working as intended
        -   Engineer - Fixed several issues which prevented the class from working as intended
    
    3.  HIGHLIGHTS SINCE PUBLIC ALPHA 0.0.12.0:
    
        -   Added several new encounters and enemy types
        -   Made some substantial changes to spellcrafting:
            -   The minimum number of runes required to make a spell has been reduced from 3 to 2.
            -   The maximum number of runes that can be in a spell has been reduced from 10 to 5.
            -   All crafted spells now start at the same relative power tier
            -   Learned spells can now be upgraded at Arcane Obelisks or via Obelisk Shards. Obelisks can be unlocked by completing settlement quests. Obelisks and shards can also be found scattered throughout the world.
            -   Intelligence now plays a more important roll in spell damage.
            -   Staves now reduce the stamina cost of spells
            -   Rune of Power, Rune of Speed, and Rune of Time have been removed from the game.
        -   Enhanced the random description generator for player characters
        -   Added the ability to tell certain party members to stay where they are and not follow you
        -   Performance improvements

    1.  NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 12:
    
        -   This alpha release introduces a pretty big game-changer regarding accessibility - FARA can now enjoyed with a mouse or touchscreen! As much as I love writing beefy changelogs, the changes are pretty simple:
            -   Clicking/tapping objects on the side panels will display a tiny\* menu with various contextual actions
            -   Clicking anywhere in the central game log or status section will provide access to more general commands and features
            -   Clicking on a map tile will now move your character toward that tile. If you're in a local area, you'll zip right to the targeted location in one click. If you're on the world map, you'll move one tile in the direction of the cursor. Clicking the center tile will search the area.
    
    2.  QUALITY OF LIFE AND OTHER CHANGES:
    
        -   Rebalanced health values across all classes. If your favorite class went from 'Above Average' to 'Average' health, it doesn't necessarily mean the value is lower than before. Additionally, the classifications of health no longer vary between classes. Two classes with 'Above Average' health now have exactly the same amount.
        -   Pressing the [ enter ] key will now trigger the /interact function with your target if the command prompt is closed.
        -   Dramatically improved the pathfinding capabilities of NPCs.
        -   Added richer descriptions and additional mouse menu options for those interested in playing with the UI disabled
        -   Added /moveto command which pathfinds your way to a target
        -   /takeall no longer picks up Supply Crates and Barrels
        -   /salvage and /salvageall will now open all nearby Supply Crates and Barrels
        -   Tweaked some things to make the game less frustrating for players who (for whatever reason) want to play the game on mobile devices. FARA still isn't exactly mobile-friendly and I still wouldn't recommend playing it on a phone if you can help it, but this patch should make such a thing far more possible, particularly on Android devices running Chrome.
        -   Fixed a bug that prevented the dexterity score of certain animals and monsters from being properly applied
        -   Fixed a bug that could cause cooking from the Quick Actions menu to cook the wrong item
        -   Fixed a crash related to destroying boulders
        -   Fixed a bug that would cause party members to rob you in your sleep. May re-add.
        -   Fixed a bug with climbing that allowed entities to remain elevated even if the climbed item was destroyed
        -   Fixed a bug that caused commoners to suggest visiting the town you're already in
        -   Fixed a bug that could cause colosseum Champions to leave a life of glory behind in favor of murdering you in your sleep for no reason in particular
        -   Fixed a bug that allowed abused Combat Dummies to cast aside their shackles and hunt down their oppressors
    
    3.  HIGHLIGHTS SINCE PUBLIC ALPHA 0.0.11.0:
    
        -   Farming! It's pretty simple for now - drop a seed into a Hole and it'll turn into a Plot. After a day or so, your new plant(s) will shoot out of the ground.
        -   Revamped settlements with more organized layouts, plots for new developments, and the partial re-introduction of quest-based town expansion
        -   More descriptive combat logs
        -   Quests from Bounty Boards no longer disappear when accepted and can be abandoned and tracked again later.
        -   Dramatically increased the performance of map animations with minimal\* downsides
        -   Butchering a salvaging now teach you about the objects/animals before dismantling them
        -   Added an /exit command which will return the player to the world map from a local area. It can also be done with /leave.
        -   Expanded the functionality of /interact
        -   Added some friendly fire protection. Attacking a healthy party member once will no longer cause them to turn on you. Attacking them a second time within a certain time frame or while they are Injured or Dying will cause them to retaliate.
        -   Overhauled the movement speed system and made the stat visible in the /character window
        -   Increased the health of several classes designed to fair well in melee combat

### Alpha 11 Feb'19..

1.  2019.02.16 Patch Notes

    -   Added farming! It's pretty simple for now - drop a seed into a Hole and it'll

        ground.
    
    -   In order for rescue quests to be completed successfully, the person must now
        be returned alive.
    
    -   NPCs with high Intelligence or Wisdom are now more prone to casting offensive
        spells in combat, and other NPCs are now slightly less inclined.
    
    -   Fixed an issue where a notable NPC could rob you in your sleep, causing them
        to be labelled a thief and eventually run away forever
    
    -   Fixed a display issue that would show sleeping entities as both Resting and
        Sleeping
    
    -   Fixed a crash on startup caused by attempting to reference some deleted
        resources

2.  2019.02.15 Patch Notes

    -   Did some work on settlements:
        -   Settlements are laid out a little more thoughtfully,
            almost as if they were made by sentient beings with some sort plan in mind.
        
        -   Increased the size of settlements and the average number of buildings.
            As a friendly reminder, you can quickly exit local areas and settlements by typing /exit.
        
        -   Started re-implementing town expansion.
            There's only one functioning tier at the moment, but buildings will pop up on
            the empty dirt plots as you complete quests.  Any entities on these plots when
            the building spawns will be moved elsewhere or vaporized if there is nowhere
            else for them to go.
        
        -   Quests accepted from Bounty Boards and elsewhere are no longer removed from
            their sources, and remain available even if abandoned.
    
    -   Dramatically increased the performance of map animations with minimal\* downsides
    
    -   Increased the stamina cost of all spells
    
    -   Increased the amount of stamina regained from all consumables

        same as /makespell.
    
    -   Additionally, /maketome is now a valid alternative to /makespell.
    
    -   Butchering unknown monsters will now automatically teach you  about them.
    
    -   Entities can now dance around any burning object, not just campfires.
    
    -   Changed the distribution of monsters in dungeons to be more evenly spread
    
    -   Fixed an issue with Den generation
    
    -   Fixed several issues with Combat Dummies not fully resetting
    
    -   Fixed an issue that prevented the piercing effect of crossbows from doing damage
    
    -   Fixed a bug that prevented the targeting reticle from showing when selecting a
        target for the first time with [ tab ]

        elemental assignments
    
    -   Fixed an issue that allowed entities to bring their parties into colloseums
    
    -   Fixed an issue that made certain high profile NPCs very loose with their
        valuables

4.  2019.02.10 Patch Notes

    -   Expanded the functionality of /interact.
        
        It will now:
        
        -   Harvest/Butcher valid targets
        
        -   Attack hostile entities in range
        
        -   Attempt to pick up most takeable items
        
        -   Smash open Supply Crates and Barrels.
            /open will also do this.
        
        -   The contents of campfires, fire pits, and other similar objects
            are now displayed as targetable options in the Nearby window.
        
        -   The /open command no longer empties these objects out.
        
        -   Removed a bunch of container-y sounding items
            because you can't actually put things in them and it was confusing.
        
        -   Workbenches are no longer fixed items and can be moved around
        
        -   Updated the Quick Actions window with a few more interactions
        
        -   Re-added several items that hadn't made the transition to Alpha 11
        
        -   Settlements and most other landmarks no longer appear on ocean tiles.
        
        -   Got rid of the odd little dangling tile at the southern tip of every local area
        
        -   Fixed an error that prevented certain ingots from being classified as metals
        
        -   Fixed a bug that allowed mercenaries to remain recruitable if you've attacked them
        
        -   Engine optimizations

5.  2019.02.08 Patch Notes

    -   Added party member locations to the /party window
    
    -   Added some friendly fire protection. Attacking a healthy party member once
        will no longer cause them to turn on you. Attacking them a second time within
        a certain time frame or while they are Injured or Dying will cause them to
        retaliate.
    
    -   Adjusted auto-targeting to not always fixate on your ridden mount while moving
    
    -   Increased the maximum light radius larger illuminated objects
    
    -   Fixed an issue with illuminated entities not being targetable if they were
        beyond the vision radius determined by ambient light
    
    -   Fixed a crash caused by delayed events attempting to reference areas that no
        longer exist
    
    -   Fixed a bug that prevented certain NPCs from vanishing unless the player was
        looking at them
    
    -   Fixed a bug that caused all human NPCs to strip naked and confess to crimes
        they didn't commit
    
    -   Fixed some typos and verbiage
    
    -   Engine optimizations

6.  2019.02.07 Patch Notes

    -   Ranged weapons now derive a substantial portion of their damage from the
        material of the ammunition they're firing. Softer ammunition like wood and
        bone will do less damage than before, while ammunition made from harder
        materials like steel and diamond will do more than before.
    
    -   Ranged weapons now specify what kind of ammunition is being fired in the game
        log.
    
    -   Interacting with a waterskin or similar container while near a water source
        like a river or well will now fill the container. Conversely, interacting with
        a well will now fill all waterskins.
    
    -   Typing /drink or /eat while near or in a river with no target selected will
        now cause you to drink from the river.
    
    -   Drinking from river or well one time will now completely eliminate your
        thirst.
    
    -   Rivers will no longer appear on ocean tiles
    
    -   Hostile NPCs who chase the player off a local map will now regroup somewhere
        near the center of the area
    
    -   Made some adjustments to the starting camp and starting recipes
    
    -   Fixed a bug that caused mounted entities to actually move slower in many cases

7.  2019.02.06 Patch Notes

    -   Added an /exit command which will return the player to the world map from a
        local area. It can also be done with /leave.
    
    -   Added some material variety to the ammunition of common ranged enemies
    
    -   Ammunition has been removed as a possibility from supply crates/barrels and
        has been replaced with various ingot types.
    
    -   Increased the vision radius of morning to mirror afternoon under most
        circumstances
    
    -   Increased the average size of local areas by a small amount
    
    -   Increased the average reward rarities provided by all chest sizes above Small
    
    -   Decreased the health of some common enemy types by about 20%
    
    -   Adjusted the nearby target listing to roughly descend from closest to farthest
    
    -   The default command/autocomplete for /explore is now /enter. /explore is still
        a valid alternative.
    
    -   Made some tweaks to movement speeds. Very tiny animals are no longer
        unreasonably fast, and very large animals are no longer impossibly slow.
    
    -   Fixed a crash caused by viewing the character window of characters created
        before version 0.0.11.3.
    
    -   Fixed some display issues when playing with colored text disabled
    
    -   Fixed a bug that caused players to get crushed by their own walls and floor
        tiles

8.  2019.02.05 Patch Notes

    -   Entities that are being ridden no longer participate in combat unless the
        rider is an Equestrian
    
    -   Knocking mounted entities or their mounts prone will now dismount the rider
    
    -   Increased the attack speed penalty for using ranged weapons without
        quivers/bandoliers
    
    -   Fixed a crash caused by jumping while mounted and most other times
    
    -   Fixed a bug that could cause multiple encounters to stack in the same area at
        the same time
    
    -   Fixed bug that caused /interact to open chests incorrectly
    
    -   Fixed a bug that caused players to get crushed by their own shelters

9.  2019.02.03 Patch Notes

    -   Added a stat to track flowers picked
    
    -   Overhauled the movement speed system and made the stat visible in the
        /character window
    
    -   Increased the health of several classes designed to fair well in melee combat
    
    -   Reduced the damage of most ranged weaponry
    
    -   Reduced the opacity of certain map markers so the entities underneath can
        still be seen
    
    -   Updated the Landmarks Found and Dungeons Entered stats to work with the new
        area systems
    
    -   Made some changes to the resting message so it's more obvious which factors
        are contributing to a safe and restful night
    
    -   Fixed a bug which caused Hunts and Expeditions to expire well before the
        player had any hope of reaching the area
    
    -   Fixed several bugs that caused items to spawn in other dimensions. If you were
        ever stopped from walking into a space by "???", this bug was probably why.
    
    -   Fixed a crash caused by Supply Crates in the starting area
    
    -   Fixed a crash related to ponds (nearbyObjects not defined)

10. 2019.02.01 Patch Notes ALPHA 11

    This one is a doozy. Where do I even start?
    
    1.  NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 11:
    
        -   Combat and object interactions have been removed from the overworld.
            
            Most of the game now takes place at the zoom level once reserved for indoor
            spaces and dungeons. While viewing the overworld map, press [ Enter ], [ e ],
            or type /explore to drop down to the local level.
            
            -   As you travel, you will happen upon encounters which automatically trigger
                the local view. Having most the game take place at the local level offers
                many new and exciting perks:
        
        -   Bump to attack!
            Under most circumstances, living entities can no longer share the same map
            tile. Among other things, this means you can now attack hostile targets by
            simply walking into them.
        
        -   Ranged weaponry in general is now much more viable.
        
        -   Most interactions that required entities to be on the same tile can now
            happen from 1 tile away.
        
        -   The open spaces allow for more tactical combat. You can utilize terrain
            features for cover, stand against large objects to avoid being surrounded, or
            climb trees to get a better vantage.
        
        -   NPC path-finding has been beefed up so they aren't so easily bested by trees
            and building corners.
        
        -   Area of effect spells have been reworked to take advantage of multiple tiles
        
        -   The jumping mechanic has been reworked, and is now an indispensable tool
            when dealing with attackers at range.
        
        -   Settlements and encampments are now truly explorable areas.
        
        -   Buildings as items have been removed, and instead players can craft walls and
            floor tiles. Using these, you can create any building size and shape you want!
        
        -   Rivers and ponds are no longer targetable objects, and are instead features
            of the landscape you can walk up to and utilize.
        
        -   Several classes have been tweaked to take advantage of the new mechanics and
            space.
        
        -   Added several new map effects to basic combat
        
        -   Added pigments! Pigments allow you mark an area with a specific color, and can
            be combined to produce every color under the rainbow.
        
        -   Added a little color variety to the target dots on the map
        
        -   Added party member items to the /compare window
        
        -   Reworked the robbery mechanic to be a bit more engaging and straightforward
        
        -   ADDED THE ABILITY TO PET ANIMALS
        
        Getting all of the old systems up to speed is an ongoing effort, so expect a few
        more related patches next week that address new issues like movement speed.
    
    2.  CLASSES CHANGES:
    
        -   Adventurer: When exploring a local area, Adventurers can tell if there's
            treasure nearby.
        
        -   Dervish: New Ability: Dangerous Dance - Dervishes gain the Whirling condition
            after dancing. While whirling, Dervishes cannot be parried and have a chance
            to cleave all targets in melee range when attacking.
        
        -   Monk: New Ability: Path of Fire - When Monks jump, they have a chance to set
            enemies along their path on fire. When burned, Monks are cleansed of most
            negative conditions.
        
        -   Reaper: Greatly increased the amount of health gained from killing an enemy
        
        -   Spelunker: Instead of glowing in the dark, Spelunkers now have permanent
            Darkvision.

### Alpha 10 May'18..

1.  HIGHLIGHTS SINCE PUBLIC ALPHA 0.0.10.0:

    -   Added ~50 new items
    
    -   Added recipe items! Reading recipes will teach the reader how to create a
        specified item.
    
    -   Added a /salvageall command to salvage/butcher everything within reach. The
        command will show in the Quick Actions menu when applicable, and can also be
        done with /salvage all, /butcher all, and /butcherall.
    
    -   Dramatically increased the variety of dungeon monsters with the new prefix
        system. These prefixes should give players an idea of what areas a particular
        monster may excel, and where they might be vulnerable.
    
    -   Masterwork items may now be infused with up to two elements, granting the
        effects and resistances of both elements.
    
    -   Revamped the /define command to show multiple results and actually be helpful
    
    -   So many bug fixes I actually stopped keeping track. If it was reported before
        today, it's either been fixed or accepted as a feature.

2.  FARA Public release May 2018

    This is far and away the biggest update FARA has received since its public
    release in May 2018, and I'd love your feedback. If you haven't already, please
    consider joining us on Discord! <https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn>
    
    Finally, I want to give a BIG shout out to everyone in the FARA Discord who
    helped test earlier versions of this release over the past two weeks. They
    suffered tremendously so that you might suffer slightly less. These expansive
    changes might have never seen the light of day were it not for their positive
    feedback and encouragement, so thanks for taking the time to provide some top
    notch insights. There is still plenty of in-game text that needs updating and
    bugs that need squashing, so if you come across something that doesn't seem
    quite right, be sure to let me know!

This document is hereby released without any claim of ownership on other

The one thing I'd ask you to do is link back to these notes if you're taking
anything I've added value to by creating this original assemblage of facts.

Thus, if you want to populate the wiki by cribbing from here .. link back.
I link back to the wiki and every source I've cited. So should you. Thanks!

## Linux

To run this game in linux, this is what you need to know.

-   you need sudo access/rights
    
    once you unpack the distribution, change to the game directory and issue

    sudo chmod +x ./FARA
    sudo chmod 4755 chrome-sandbox
    sudo chown root:root chrome-sandbox

you likely wont be able to run the game from your file-manager since FARA is technically
a shared library, so, from the shell type **./FARA** to get it going from its dir.

if you want a thing to right-click to start the game, issue:

    echo ./FARA >./fara
    sudo chmod +x ./fara

-   save-games go into **~/.config/FARA**

that's chrome's doing and because the save-files are pretty large consider
symlinking that path to a place thats backed-up once a day, not hourly.

-   the game plays well under X
    
    and since the only time it really needs the disk is
     for saving, you can run it from a NAS or server without troubles.
    
    /uianimation and screen-shaking should be disabled under X

-   the actual thing you would appear to need to update between versions,
    as long as the runtime does not change is 'resources/app.asar'.
    its amazing that its just 2.8mb.


<a id="org97ccf8e"></a>

## Requirements

Pug's experiments suggest:

-   FARA needs at least three concurrent threads to be performant
    -   Anything better than a Dual-core CPU will do!
        With a Dual-core you'll see the game slow to ~half speed after ~24hrs play.
-   2.2+ GHZ will be tolerable through a long game.
-   4ish GB RAM for Chrome/Electron/FARA (at most! usuall much less, no problem.)
-   Disk seems not important.

What's optimal? Anything Quad-core with DDR-4 RAM but DDR-3 will do.
The real key to good performance appears to be the size of your [CPU cache](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-cpu-cache/).

### Resizing & Positioning the FARA Window

I play on an upright external monitor. Since changes to /bigmap make it scale
with the height of the window FARA runs in without considering the width, I
need to change the FARA window size to make the most of /bigmap.

Using Windows you'd want to look at these links

-   [save-window-locations-of-applications](https://superuser.com/questions/240362/save-window-locations-of-applications)
-   [fix-windows-not-remembering-window-positions-and-sizes](https://appuals.com/fix-windows-not-remembering-window-positions-and-sizes/)

In Linux, grab a hold of [**xdotool**](https://www.startpage.com/sp/search?query=obtaining+xdotool), then save and adapt this script to your needs.

    #!/bin/bash
    
    setfarawin(){
      local a=$(xdotool search --onlyvisible --name "FARA")
      xdotool getwindowgeometry $a
      xdotool windowmove $a 1372 641
      xdotool windowsize $a 1074 1100
    }
    
    <pathtoyourlocalinstall>/FARA &
    sleep 0.1
    setfarawin

### Fixing crashes

While not an open source application per se, with an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) application such
as FARA one can [always](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/219) count on having [access](https://medium.com/hackernoon/javascript-compilation-epoch-ebfb7b5bb664) to the code for personal use even
though one is dealing with an 'All rights reserved' kind of license.

Much like with [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash), you can easily [unpack](https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=app.asar) the program, change the fonts and
user interface to please you without any loss in performance. Additionally with
a little [extra](https://www.thaoh.net/prettyjs/) [effort](https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/) you can learn to appreciate Brian's work a whole lot more
by taking a look at what's being shipped.

Obfuscated and linearized as the code is, you can't expect to do much but make
whatever crashes between minor release go away, but since you can do these
things inside an hour or less, learning a little bit about the way modern
software ticks and how it is shipped will let you glide past the otherwise
game-ending troubles that sometimes slip in between major release.

In this sense, and within these limits I can tolerate dealing with software that
isn't really free and open. Besides, there's no game like [learning](https://www.startpage.com/sp/search?query=developing+electron+apps+jetbrains) by doing

This will make more sense to you once you've had your system and your data
destroyed and obsoleted by proprietary code a few times. Then you too might
appreciate the importance of free and open software and see the value of
acquiring some of the [basic technical skills](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) hinted at here.

Anyway, if you want to mess with things, make sure to use **/stopreports**!  And
do yourself a favor, never use this approach to cheat or learn game secrets or
you will ruin your own fun. Let playing continue to be an enjoyable sandbox!

## Visualizing Waypoints

Just some unrealistic ideas for visualizing the world-map as this document comes
to a close.

-   Watercolor paper and a pair of compasses :-)
-   or disembody and hack up something ;-)
    <https://www.startpage.com/sp/search?query=visualize+relative+location+edge+distance>
-   graphvis doesn't do edge-lengths, at least i dont think so,
-   but maybe some simple scripts with an adjustable data section in an svg would
    empower players smart and geeky enough to keep notes about their world.
