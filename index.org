* Intro

I love the depth and variety in this game. The encounters can be short and
sweet, or long and trecherous. The world has beauty and there is heaps of
creativity in the maps and their many variations. The exploration and combat systems
are challenging yet you never feel as if the game is out to get you.

FARA is a Nethack for the new millenium.
Its brilliant and innovative like a rogue done right!
  -- Pug.
#+end_quote

FARA is an open world sandbox that never rushes you to advance, while seeming to
adapt to your powers to keep even low difficulty zones full of surprises. You
will enjoy the turn-based combat, the ability to explore dangerous places with
capable and fearless mercenaries to help. There are 52 classes with unique
traits that simply make sense. The RPG steretypes and classes you know will 
begin to look primitive as you learn to play different classes and explore
FARA's many mysteries.

If you don't know what I'm talking about, visit [[https://brianiscreative.itch.io/fara][FARA's Homepage]] and take a look
at these [[https://www.startpage.com/sp/search?query=FARA+Rougelike+youtube&cat=video][Game-play videos]].

** Notes
This page serves as a repository for my notes about the game. 

During my first play-session some years ago I hit a wall and swore to myself
that I would beat this thing one day. And I finally have.

It was not a big, triumphant, clever win. Definitely not! I played what looked
to me like the most survivable class, the [[GATEKEEPER][Gatekeeper]] as defensively as I could
and for 150 days stuck my head into dangerous places, learning and exploring as
I went - and now that my understanding has grown, my notes and my approach to
them is evolving too.

Winning, for me meant 'Completing the Astral Key'. It also marks the beginning
of what puts my Character into the 'Age of Steel', sees me Mining and Fishing
more, and at last! has me manage inventory and items the way the Gods intended.

Pug's Notes below don't reflect all I've learned by reaching my milestone yet,
but they are not harmful if you're just starting out.

The note are a single page so they can be searched with ease and confidence.
Use *Ctrl-F* in your browser to look for things, then press *Backspace* to return
where you started. 

As these notes change 'rolling unannounced updates' appear on the [[https://fara-pug.github.io/fara-pug/][web-page
hosted at github]]. The HTML version I link to has a style-sheet optimized for
readability. I keep meaning to use that for proof-reading.

A second, alway in sync version uses a [[https://github.com/fara-pug/fara-pug/blob/main/index.md][crisper more technical style]] that makes
the notes and tables look quite nice also.

The writing and production of these docs takes place in Emacs/org-mode since
that's what I know and spend a lot of time with IRL. As every emacs user wants
to spread the gospel, I invite you to take a look at [[https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=emacs+org+mode+outline+youtube][some org-mode videos]].
Long story short, if/when you try org-mode you'll want to use the [[https://github.com/fara-pug/fara-pug][source-document]].


Since my schedule does not allow me to play all that often, find out about
updates to the notes by subscribing to [[https://github.com/fara-pug.atom]] via an
rss-feed reader. I like the [[https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=Feedbro+Reader][Feedbro Reader]] since it works well in almost any
browser. Set the update interval to weekly to catch up with changes and

I will see any DM's you send me on Discord, when I'm not busy elsewhere since
Discord doesn't get to email me. To get my attention though, make an account on

Email will reach me most weeks.

*** Blights

Instead of simply dying and dumbfoundedly staring at your screen, the whatever
happened to you bring you into the game happens again and you get a chance to
come back to solve the real mysteries of FARA.

That's to say you somehow come back to life, just a little shaken and just a
little bit worse. When you come back, you might suffer or notice one of these
effects (a lot of people died researching this. a moment of silence please!):

- Stronger Enemies
- Increased Encounter Rate
- Increased Damage Taken
- Reduced Damage Dealt
- Increased Stamina Use
- Reduced Food Effects
- Reduced Inventory Capacity (-5 per blight)
- Reduced Strength
- Reduced Finesse
- Reduced Resilienc
- Reduced Insight
- Reduced Charm


Each of these blights decreases your chances of resurrecting again. Exactly what
that means is unclear.. except that it will prevent you from cultivating your follies.

Feedback:
- I got 4 blights once. I never got more than 4, though this doesn't necessarily
  mean its impossible. It would require a lot of testing to be sure.
- Taking the first blight is a guaranteed success I think? I never had it fail,
  and it does make sense.
- Do not attack Relica's elder. He will end your run, and no amount of blights
  will ever save you from his unending wrath.
- I think you might have an increased chance of levelling up a blight instead of
  getting a new one if you already have it.

My testing was not extensive, I only kept going until I was pretty sure I'd seen
all the blights. tbh 1, 2, and 4 would require some very rigorous testing to be
sure.

*** Character Stats
- see /define for great upto-date info
- includes info from discord and https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Character_Stats
- If you have high health and high resilience then you are probably good at tanking
- Moods affect your stats positively as well as negatively.
- Being sleepy or well rested affects your stats as well
- "c" shows your stats of the moment, moods, tiredness & equipment included.

**** Details
***** Strength

- Increases damage dealt with melee weaponry
- Increases damage dealt through unarmed strikes
- Decreases stamina spent pushing large objects.
- Increases your chances of succeeding at a */grab*

STR weapons should do the most damage per hit in close quarters.
(Weapon damage is not depended on weapon size, but refinement and materials)

***** Finesse

- Increases damage dealt with range weaponry
- Increases chance to disarm traps,
- Increases stealth ability
- Increases your */dash* distance and (maybe?) decreases its stamina cost
- Decreases reload time of ranged weapons
- Decreases stamina used by jumping and stealth.

Makes you good at hiding, attacking from range, with daggers and  other finesse weaponry

***** Resilience

- Reduces physical damage taken,
- Reduces duration of negative effects,
- Increases stamina regeneration rate.
- Warhammer heavies do more damage based on RES

***** Insight

Makes you good with Spells, Staves, Focuses, Wands and Scepters.

- Increases the damage of spells,
- Increases your search ability,
- Decreases the stamina cost of spells.

***** Charm

- Increases the duration of buffs/positive effects
- Increases odds of favorable outcomes (such as?)
- Does it Decreases the duration of mali/negative effects??

Your charm doesn't increase your ability to lead a party and it does
not affect your party's maximum size. (max party size may be class dependent)

Charm does make it easier to form good relationships with NPCs, meaning that
with more charm */joke*, */gossip*, etc. will be better received and they
will think you more of a friend for doing quests for them.

Unsure how that matters. Will they remember your birthday? Give more loot?

More important.. If charm is luck and insight searching, then why isn't everyone
talking about making shovels and fishing-rods from crystal or even obsidian?
I think some testing is in order.. Can it be that people don't like setting up
house on the beach? Whats going on there..


**** Health Brackets
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2558d375-eadc-4e66-ae1e-3dffe31794b9
:END:
- Healthy = full health
- Wounded = Starts at ~75%
- Injured = Starts at ~50%
- Dying = Starts at ~25%

**** Stat Brackets
Stats are reported in the character screen "*c*" where you can see your relative
skill as determined by a skill bracket. The brackets are made up of several
levels of individual + or - gained from gear.

| -20 | TRAGIC                         |
| -16 | Dreadful (4 steps)             |
| -12 | Terrible (4 steps)             |
|  -8 | Awful (4 steps)                |
|  -4 | Poor (4 steps)                 |
|  -1 | Below Average (3 steps)        |
|   0 | Average (1 step)               |
|   1 | Above Average (3 steps)        |
|   4 | Good/Good+ (4 steps)           |
|   8 | Excellent/Excellent+ (4 steps) |
|  12 | Legendary (4 steps)            |
|  16 | Legendary+ (4 steps)           |
|  20 | GODLIKE                        |

- Starting stats are in ±2 increments from average.
- Ecstatic adds a flat +3 steps to all stats.
- Does Godlike always blink or only when you tried to push past 20?

***** for example
If you start as a Gamehunter with

- above average STR (2),
- good DEX (4),
- and below average CHA (-2),
- you would need +2 STR from gear to go from above average (2) to good (4),
-  or +1 INT to go from average (0) to above average (1).

To achieve GODLIKE DEX you'd need +16 DEX.

**** Damage reduction
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       77a590eb-d965-4894-b522-789f1b7c7769
:END:
Resilience is tied to Damage reduction (DR)
- Shield give DR, at the cost of jumping costing more stamina
- Multiple sources of DR stack
- Fishmonger gets a bunch of DR by being drunk

**** Notes

Stats are improved by wearing or holding gear with stat alterations
affixed. Most of these affixes are determined by the Crafting Materials that the
item is made out of, but some can come from the item itself, or tools that
further enhance items.

We need a table of Item characteristics!
- perhaps someone with godlike stats would post a savegame to look at for the
  details in the recipes they've collected somewhere?
- perhaps the brain will give us a button to export such a list for things known
  inside a game!
*** Key fragments

- One for every 10 unknown monsters you inspect. 
- It is possible to win just by inspecting monsters.
  - Winning isn't the end.
  - I think its after you do that the real game starts.
- One for reaching max renown with a faction.
- Rarely and randomly, from fishing or digging.
- At the end of Dungeons.
- By ending Nobles, even Village Elders.
- Check your */spells* spell-list for emergency and post-win uses.

**** Meta
I read that each new shard contibutes more points to your score than the previous one.

Thus if you aim to level up your stats by putting shards into them you should do
it with the 9th shard so that you collect the most unlock points for doing that.

Go to relica and spend an IRL day farming nothing but 'find monster' quests and
tell me how far you get and how long it takes.

***** crazy math
If you're strong enough to move to another settlement, can you turn your naked
self into a being with godlike stats while unlocking all the classes playing the
meta-game of animal researcher?

there are 5 primary stats. lets say they average '10 of 20'. you'd need 50 9th
shards to become a god. that's 500 new animal species discovered, and maybe 500
days spent in game.

hmm, lol, i wonder how long brute-forcing 10 find-animal quests would take and
if i could resist the urge to just complete the key to be done with the game.

maybe i should complete the key first and see what revelations that brings.
decisions. decisions. /end crazy math
*** Resting
I read that you can rest on mats. that's not true.

You need/want
- a whatever bed, unsure that materials provide boni to sleep
- to be within the glow of a brazier (what else works?)
- to be behind any kind of door.

Now... if you find a blanket or a pillow count yourself lucky!

Pillows need feathers.. and the only way i can imagine getting any feathers is
from a bird joining battle, angered by my taking their nest of of their tree.
i've been collecting nests, but so far no angry birds.

I found the pillow recipe, so those exists; atm blankets may or may not exist,
speculating that they do because coolness. i dont really expect the buffs to get
stronger with pillow and blanket, but this was just an excuse to remind you of
the three easy things you want to do to get buffed sleeping: bed/heat/door.

In the end i got so mad at the useless nests however that I started kicking them
out of their trees, well, kindof. Now I have my pillows!

- Castles, Fortresses, Labyrinths, Random and even delapidated ruins all count
  as safe indoor sleeping places even if undiscovered enemies remain.

- Got woken up after building a shack on a map with an undiscovered species I
  was looking for. Once. So far I've never been attacked at night even sleeping
  in ruins.

Its a good idea to keep a wooden log in your inventory so you don't have to
scrounge for one in the middle of the night while traveling!

** Classes
I forgot where i stole this :( The idea is that i'll integrate the class
relevant bits from the release notes and insights gleaned on discord here.

***** Fishmonger...
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       30e0adc4-5d08-4165-9d06-2b5166a16354
:END:
- Fishmonger's really grindy if you want to do it
- Get a whole lot of dowels
- Waypoint your spawn area
- Once you've got a huge amount of dowels
- Get a crystal/iron/bronze fishing rod
- Any uncommon tier fishing rod
- Crafted with wooden blocks
- Used for tools
- So you've got your huge pile of dowels
- (~100)
- wow
- And your uncommon fishing rod
- Preferably iron, since it's easiest
- (find a fortress and salvage the doors)
- (You need to craft a wooden fishing rod to unlock other recipes)
- Now, go back to spawn with the lake
- And fish until the rod's ruined
- With the Fishmonger trait, you should have enough runes to salvage into runic shards and make a repair kit with your dowels + shards
- Use the repair kit to repair the rod
- Repeat that process
- passing down anchient knowlage
- You should slowly get enough extra runic shards to craft refined tools (25 shards)
- Use them on the fishing rod
- Continue fishing until the rod is [ruined] and repairing the rod by salvaging the runes
- Make it artisan (50 shards)
- Then start making your other equipment refined
- And then artisan
- secret knowlage here wow
- You should also get a whole bunch of runes that are useful for you
- Get a rune of curses and a rune of intoxication
- And set them aside when you get them
- Once you've got both, drop them in the same place and use /makespell or /ms
- You will now have an arcane curse of intoxication
- Fishmonger takes significantly reduced damage while intoxicated, so you can /selfcast 3 to give yourself an arcane curse of intoxication
- The reason the element chosen is arcane is because very few entities use the arcane element
- And curse spells increase damage taken from an element
- The intoxication rune has to be on an attacking spell, since it's a negative effect
- Basically You curse yourself with intoxication + increased arcane damage taken
- i knew thats an exploit. i just thought i could use some vodka or smth :slight_smile:
- But nothing really uses the arcane element so you only really get intoxication
- Yes, you can use vodka and all other alcohol
- so in summery fish fish fish curse fish fish fish and get POWA
- Fishmonger has 2 spell slots, so you can make a second spell too
- the intox debuff gives you +RES and +CHA
- But once you have a bunch of booze and a tower shield then you are practically unkillable

https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Botanist

Botanist is one of the interesting classes you can use in Fara, their unique
ability "Familiar Phytology" has a huge potential if you know how to use it
efficiently. First of all let's see what the ability is about.

Familiar Phytology - Botanists have access to the Enrich Plant skill, which
allows them to turn any plant into allied Plant baby. Feeding Plant Babies by
hand will cause them to grow more powerful, and the chosen food will determine
what abilities/skills they have. Casting Enrich Plant while already having a
plant familiar will kill the older familiar.

Basically after using the "Enrich Plant" skill of the botanist on trees or
bushes will turn them into an ally plant baby. An allied plan has a total of 4
stages.

- Plant baby, Plant kid, Plant beast, Plant behemoth

As you may have read earlier plant allies can be evolved by being hand fed
anything that is edible. You will need a total of 55 food to max out the
evolution process of your plant, but always remember to think about on what the
55th food will be since that will determine what type of behemoth you will get!
Other than being being able to get them from your first day in your run, you can
make new ones that will be stronger the farther you are from Relica! So far I
have only tapped into Veteran behemoths but I think there are far more stronger
variants the farther we go, for now I will show the stats of an amateur ones
below.

Number of how many you have to feed before evolving along with stats and skills

|----------+----------+---------------+--------------|
| Plant    | Feedings | Stats         | Skills       |
|----------+----------+---------------+--------------|
| Baby     |        5 | average       | None         |
| Kid      |       15 | above average | None         |
| Beast    |       35 | good          | Thorn volley |
| Behemoth |        ? | ?             | ?            |
| Beasts   |        ? | ?             | ?            |
|----------+----------+---------------+--------------|

Plant Behemoth	max	Will depend on what kind of behemoth you make
Will also depend on what kind you make

This may help you in the early run if you can get them into a behemoth fast
since you may also get a mercenary as another companion with your first battle
chest reward when you get to Relica. The stats will go up as you make plant
allies when you are farther Relica, and also another good thing is it will not
cost you anything other than some few seeds and berries here and there.

 and their type (which determines attunement,
 spells, and stats) is based on what you feed them.
 Fruit = tropical, for one example.

***** Link to list of known songs here
The Rhapsodist is a class in FARA with a very unique play style.
 Whenever the Rhapsodist attacks, it plays a note.
 The note is dependent if the attack is a normal or a Heavy.
 When you sing four notes, it makes a song.
 Different songs have different effects.
 The order of the notes in the song does matter, unless it's the Cleansing song.
 The two notes are short (normal attack) and long (heavy attack).
 All buffs applied to allies with songs are also applied to yourself.

Note 1	Note 2	Note 3	Note 4	Song Name	Effect
See below*				Song of Cleansing|	removing negative effects from nearby allies
Long	Long	Long	Long	Song of Destruction|	boosting attack power of nearby allies
Short	Long	Short	Short	Song of Shadows|	enter in stealth
Short	Short	Long	Short	Song of Diligence|	reducing the stamina used by nearby allies
Long	Long	Long	Short	Song of Sadness|	decreasing the mood of nearby enemies
Long	Long	Short	Long	Song of Bliss|	increasing the mood of nearby allies
Short	Long	Long	Long	Song of Wastrels|	draining stamina of nearby enemies
Short	Short	Short	Long	Song of Protection|	reduce damage taken by allies
Short	Short	Short	Short	Song of Lasting|	increase duration of nearby effect
Long	Short	Long	Long	Song of Light|	illuminating nearby enemies
The attacks don't have to be consecutive, and only the last one has to hit a target for the song to start.

For example: you can hit the air three times, travel to another tile, wait for a full day and even rest and you will complete the song on your next valid attack (as of 0.0.15.18b)


*There's seven different ways of performing a Song of Cleansing*:
 2S and 2L (in any order) and L - S - S - S

** Damage Types

There are eight types of damage in FARA.

Physical attacks are countered by "Damage Reduction" provided those held shield
items in combination with Resilience and Strength, i suppose.

Magical attacks are countered by your elemental attunement which is enhanced by
your Insight? and a shield spell. Did I get that right?

*** Physical

+ Elemental Effects on hard-attacks.
- melee
  - slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing,
  - (see Radiant hand trait if you're looking for physical resistances)
- ranged 

Elemental runes on your weapon give you a bonus and weaken your target.

If you have more than one elemental rune on your weapon, then they will
alternate with each hard attack you make.

FARA canon seems to be to use a single water-rune on your weapon and nothing
else since a little bit of extra water-attunement will make your rejuvenating
healing spell work ever so much better for you -- and of course weaken your
foe's water/healing attunement as well.

*** Magical
.. and then there is Arcane, an untyped damage belonging to no element at all.
Mobs don't seem to use it nor do they appear to have resistance against it.
If you feel like doing without the elemental effects, think 'arcane'.

if you use an arcane shield or other rare arcane infused elements you do more
damage and resist arcane spells

*** Elemental

- 6 pure
  - (+ arcane in the absence of elements, right? makes it 7 pure types.)
- 15 (16) dual/combo types
- 21 (22) magial means to confuse your self with while learning to play!

Combine two elemental runes into a spell to deliver both types under these
names - which show up in the spell name.

** Factions

When you rank up in a faction, by doing quests for them or bribing one of their
officers with 10..100 medals, you get access to their traits, which give some
very good bonuses.

|---------------+--------------------+---------+------------|
| Faction Ranks | Medals to get Rank | Traits  | Trait-Cost |
|---------------+--------------------+---------+------------|
| Recruit       |                    | 3 Minor |         10 |
| Squire        |                    | 5 Minor |         15 |
| Knight        |                    | 2 Minor |         20 |
| Champion      |                    | 2 Minor |         25 |
| Commander     |                    | 2 Minor |         30 |
| Legend        |                    | 1 Major |         35 |
|---------------+--------------------+---------+------------|

See the */factions* (aka "*F*") window for a list of Traits and the rank requirements

- Don’t enter castles of the factions that don’t like you.
- Fortresses are ok, just not castles

*** Jade circle: Social/stealth
Is a really good faction for stealthy characters
(has one of the best traits for spellcasters)

*** Will of the wild: Resource gathering/crafting/exploration
Is good for crafting a lot of stuff, and getting a lot of loot

Traits will give you options in crafting such as:
- Reduces material costs of all craftable items
- Increases materials gathered from foraging skills

*** Radiant hand: Combat/Tanking/buffs and debuffs
Focusing on Strength? go for the hand!

The three first radiant hand traits give you DR against piercing, slashing or bludgeoning damage

** Factions Traits

Check the Faction trait lists through the */factions* window, click a faction
and choose to see the list of traits and their cost in shards from the menu.

It is technically possible to get traits from multiple factions, but it requires
some grinding as each medal given to a faction will decrease your reputation
with the other two. You can also try to do some Reputation juggling by getting
the Diplomat trait and/or being the Politician class to obtain maximum rep with
more than one faction at a time.

You have three changeable trait slots! In addition to your unchangeable class
trait, you have two minor trait slots and one major trait slot you get to pickup
and repeatedly change out through study and with the help of your Faction.

#+begin_quote
On your labyrinthine journeys you're likely to find Manuals that bestow Traits
upon you. Thus there's no need to rush headlong into alliances with [[Factions][Factions]]
who's ultimate intentions you can't ever be sure about anyway.
#+end_quote

*** Trait Manuals

There are manuals for all Faction specific traits waiting to be found ingame.
I suppose the higher ranked manuals are less frequent.

- Finding/Grinding Labyrinths

** Food
- Raw food provides some stamina but no healing.
- Cooked foods provide much more stamina and restore a fixed health%.
- Its not clear if or how the health boost varies.
- They are 1u small.
- Buffs from food *replace* each other.
- mixtures, dishes and booze can drop from mobs and crates.

[[ALCHEMIST][Alchemist]]'s *Mixtures* provide higher stat bonuses for fewer ingredients and can
be consumed much faster. Throwing Mixtures at enemies will lower the relevant
stats, and throwing Mixtures at other entities will raise the relevant stats.

[[BOTANIST][Botanists]] can do all sorts of magic by feeding their babies just about anything.
Their babies evolve when they feed them. Your pets wont.

[[CHEF][Chef]]'s *Dishes* provide stat bonuses for four times the duration of Meals, and
grant an effect which fixes the eater's mood to max for an extended period.

Eating and drinking (*/eat*, */drink*) take time. *Water* and *Mixtures*
are probably hugely important for spellcasters in dire situations, but I'd need
an expert to chime in with their experience as I'm just guessing here.

*** Cooking
Everyone can */harvest* trees and shrubbery, then */cook* solid *Meals* from
single [[Ingredients][Ingredients]] in Campfires and Firepits to restore stamina and heal
themselves and their allies. The real freaks improve on that like so:

- [[ALCHEMIST][Alchemists]] produce liquid *Mixtures* instead of *Meals* when cooking.
- [[CHEF][Chefs]] produce *Dishes* instead of *Meals* when cooking.

I suppose Campfires and Firepits differ in cooking speed/capacity.
- Campfires are destroyed by immolation more quickly

*** Ingredients

- Whats missing?
- Is someone tracking the biomes for these things?

if you infuse multiple runes into a firepit you'll get the wonderful combo names
used for [[Elemental][Elemental Combos]] applied to your foodstuffs, with the last infused element
determining the elemental attunement your food will provide.

*** Fireworks!

As you're hanging out surrounded by half a dozen camp-fires plus one, cooking
up a storm, why not try frying up some runes? What's the worst that could
happen?

**** Fixed-ish
- Carts, draggable on the local map
- Storage Bins, installable
- Storage Bins, upgraded.

**** Solids
(from discord)
- The first recipe you have is for a burlap satchel
- Crafting a burlap satchel unlocks a handful of different satchel materials, and the recipe for bags with different materials
- Crafting a bag unlocks backpacks
- Crafting a backpack unlocks sacks
- Sacks are the best storage item to wear
- Followed by backpacks, then bags, then satchels
- Every rarity tier is +5 storage
- Every bag tier is another +5 storage I think
- Making it refined, artisan, or masterwork further increases capacity
- The Merchant class has significantly increased inventory capacity from the beginning
- And the Hauler trait increases your inventory capacity passively

**** Liquids
- Vial, Flask, Mug, Waterskin..

**** Party
I may be dreaming but were there no saddle-bags in that old version? Can my pet
and merc help me carry things? So much to determine yet. I should probably look
into simply equipping my new merc first.

*** Curios

Gizmos, dodads, mods, infusions.. call them what you want, once you've applied
them to a piece of equipment, you can't get rid of them again. Some of these are
really rare and I can't quite judge which those are, so .. Please don't cry if
you misapply!

Curios can be found and some of the curios, and all of those that boost one of
the 5 main stats are craftable. (Likely [[Refinery][after you have spent a fortune]] or two on
the local madman.)

*** Repairing
** Locations
*** Location List
Due to the presence of rift-energies in the land, its important that you
bookmark locations your're engaged with. Leaving them unobserved will not be
enough to keep them from drifting away from where you thought they were.

The attention bound by personal and quest bookmarks appears to attract these
drifters while the content of the world around you reorganizes itself when you
sleep. None of the citizens in your world, except perhaps elder and nobles would
appear to be aware of this.

Practically this means that special location like the ones listed here can
*often* be found in areas adjecent to or in the immediate vicinity of the sites
you have bookmarked. Settlements with their histories and many minds appear less
volatile.

All said, a good observer will often find fascinating places, as if by accident,
when they wake up after resting (well sheltered one hopes) in the woods!

tl;dr? Peek into the 8 immediate neighbors of the bookmarks you're given and
possibly walk through the 16 surrounding squares to see what's out there!

Indoor locations such as Castles and Fortresses offer free and secure overnight
lodgings.

- need more data! and stories from others!

- inital text stolen, probably from the outdated wiki
- ty discord denizens for your insights and feedback!

Cleared location where you might have a non hostile but unfriendly enemy mount
appear to attrack scoundrel after a night or two spent there. So don't be
surprised if you find yourself suddenly blinded after having stepped on a trap
while getting shot at if you tolerate these untamable collaborators!
*** Encounters
**** Abandoned Shack
Single Building in the woods, no hostiles, tool-chest .. and a single powerful trap.
- need more data
**** Ambushes
Going somewhere new you spy a Big Chest out in the open.. just a dash away and
noone's here.. you search, and seing nothing you dash.. into your doom.

Careful with the greed man, if it looks to good to be true, it is.

You've been warned, not that it matters. Good luck getting out ouf there!

Note: I've had a BigChest appear out of the blue the moment i found my first
young cat while on a woodcutting trip in the nearby woods. I wonder if that was
some kind of nod to potential cat-lovers, but i definitely made sure to search
on almost every step on the way to pick up that loot.

There were no hostiles on the map, and the cat and cow seem to have become fast
friends down at the stables. (file under 'ambushed by cats')

**** Arcane Obelisk

"Powerful Magic"

Obelisk building let's you upgrade spells

- Costly upgrades for spells you've learned.
- Costs the same as if you had unlocked an Obelisk in your settlement!
- The cheapest and most thrilling way to upgrade your spells is to hunt for
  [[Ruins][ruinous ruins]] since you'll always? find an obelisk shard among the loot there.
  A shards is just large enough power a single upgrades so perhaps save it for
  the last upgrade or two to save 20 or 35 shard, paying for it with the risk
  you're taking on. Just be clear about what you're getting into and read the
  notes for the [[Location List][Location List]] to tweak the ruin's [[Difficulty][Difficulty]].
**** The Burning House
*Danger Will Robinson*

The Burning House can be a real oh-sh*t experience. It could be on any tile that
you stumble on pyromanic imps that shoot you with magma right when you land. I
didn't find any until I had complete all the buildings in Relica and it may be
ok to save your paranoia until then.

Extrapolating from my random encouter I suspect the imps were not really
malicious, simply driven to madness by the guy making horrible music. I mean,
wouldn't he live in town with his <random instrument> if people appreciated his
music?


I wish I had not forgotten to */grab* and drag the unconscious SOB off the edge
of the map to get him looked after.
**** Campsite
Just a wilderness shack. Usually houses a recalcitrant Outlaw of one sort or the
other. Some are trying to leave their prior associates behind and change their
ways, others are just looking to hole up until the heat passes down. Too bad for
them that they see you as the threat to their lives that you are. I mean, you
would have talked to them first if they hadn't gone all hostile on you, right?

Poor Sobs, usually don't even have furniture where they sleep.

**** Encampment
- single building
**** Unknown Camp
- Faction camps with
  - 5ish assorted opponents of the same level in the open
  - 3ish leader types, same lvl in a house
  - wanted postet, big-chest
- clearing them seems to not hurt your rep with anyone.
  maybe once you have rep that changes.
- 5ish buildings offer 3+ random pieces of furniture
- its probably where you'll find your first benches
**** The Farmer
A real *<Gem>* from Discord!

"It was a random encounter, there was 1 small building, 2 commoners, and 1 farmer
NPC. The farmer NPC only gave quests to collect and return 2-3 crops (items)
from around the map, rewarding a tool chest or small check for each completed
quest.

I could repeat these indefinitely, and after a while, the chests became refined,
and then artisan. The artisan small chests gave artisan items, which I mostly
salvaged, giving me runic shards.  Basically, the farmer is a safe and infinite
(albeit a little tedious) source of runic shards."

**** Graveyard
There's a lot of tombstones in this place. It's been said that there's more to
this place that hasn't been discovered yet.

- digging up and smashing all the tombstones hasnt revealed anything to me yet.
- good place to collect soil (for pottery?) :)

**** Hunting grounds
Starts to spawn after completing certain amount of quests in one of the
villages. In other words, You can get hunting ground quests once you've become a
hero of a settlement.

On entering the hunting grounds you can find a group of hunters heavily injured,
and a lot of corpses around the place. After talking to one of them you can
accept a mission to help them against the Rift Beast that left them in that
condition.

Rift beasts are one of the toughest opponents in FARA, one of them comes to
fight you after accepting to help the hunters that show up in the hunting
grounds.

They are a challenge for any type of character, so being prepared is very important.

- in other words, forget about it. :)

(you'll sometimes find young rift beast starting maybe 100km from relica.)

**** Labyrinth

Dont go exploring them in the dead of night without a [[Lights][light]]!

Safe and super high rewards and likely to confuse the hell out out of you for
longer than you might have patience for. Be prepared for {Masterwork} items and
other items of awe .. in 90..120 minutes.

These scribbles might help you to mark up the laby while you're doing so that
you can leave and come back without loosing the place you were last exploring!

|---------------------|
| setkey 1 mark red   |
| setkey 2 mark green |
| setkey 3 mark blue  |
| setkey 4 clearmark  |
|---------------------|

- There is a labyrinth, i go in
- at a junction, i mark
- green from whence i came
- blue everywhere i'm not going yet
- i reach a dead-end and retrace my step
- at the junction from whence i came
- i mark the dead-end path red, and clear a blue
- and on i go.
- when i reach a blue, i mark it red & *retrace my step.*
- when i reach i a green and blue i red my step and clear a blue.

And working out the little nuances that make this actually work is, as they used
to say back when books were a thing.. "left as an exercise for the reader."

-- the Mintaur


Mantecarl chimes in with this incredible paint saving measure:
- I've been doing this thing in labyrinths were I set a local waypoint in all 4
  clearings, so that I can get to them if I ever ran into a corridor with no
  exits -- saves a lot of time!

**** Ruins
You come across 6/7? to 9 delapidated buildings in this frequent, somewhat hard
yet doable encounter.

In the beginning count yourself lucky if you manage to dash to the egde
undetected. If you have some wood on hand keep in mind that you can get out if
you're near the edge and that you can place the occasional extra wall or
building to beef up your position -- especially if you're playing melee -- to
break the line of sight against what will inevitably be small groups of often stealthy
casters coming after you here.

- stealth-clustered magic attackers and friends all appear to use the same element!
- bring some [[When Elementally Flamed (++)][elemental foods]] for yourself and your team, and of course a beverage!
- getting the Big Chest from the local mini boss doesnt mean you're safe!
- move to the edge if dashing to the next blg will leave you exhausted!
- use stealth, enter, drop building, move to cover!
- sevral ruined storage chest. one obsidean shard always drops here.

Sometimes though it seems as if the crew guarding the ruins has been tipped of
about your plans to attack them, and they will all be standing by your spawn point.

In these circumstances being a Gatekeeper allows you to put on your second big
shield, cast protect, a ward of fury for maximum retaliation while you attempt
to get out of that mess. If you're lucky, almost all the spellcaster will kill
themselves trying to hurt as you're making your exit.

I'm not sure that I could have managed half the research in this guide any other
way.

**** Scouts
What are these locations called again?
- Found in the wilderness.
- Belong to a faction. Are they all Will of the Wild?
- Scouts give waypoints to settlements
  within a range they know about
  All scouts within, say, 50km? 75..100km? around Relica seem to know the same thing.

**** Shrines
A powerful artifact of one of the gods rests behind the locked door which you
can /inspect to know what you need to do to open it. On each side of the shrine
there are statues, which have had a runestone pried out of them. One of the
statues is probably in disrepair.

**** Summoning Circle
- Rift beasts
- Maybe take 3 CRPs to a Summoning Circle?
**** Trader
Also another random encounter is a trader.
- Though AFAIK no one actually knows what to do with them.

TRADER... He said he had nothing to trade, so i gave him some loot, left the map
to get some more, came back, he was gone .. but had left me a BigChest.  Please
try that if you see one and confirm!

(This seeming discover appears to have surfaced a bug and atm, an upcoming update
will reset the game of figuring out what traders do. Perhaps they'll soon trade?
Stay tuned!)

**** Travelers/Caravan
(old info)

These travelers seem to have a traitor between them.
- Talk to them to figure out who it is!

As you traverse the world of FARA you might come upon caravans along your way. A
caravan consist of 5 travellers and talking to any of them you'll find out that
they have recently been attacked. They suspect one of their own, and this gives
you the chance to play detective.

Each person will list how long they've been with the group, their personal
reason for travelling, as well as a good and bad thing to do at their
destination. These are the clues to identify the odd one out.

As a reward for solving the mystery you gain the following:

- 1x big chest,
- 1x artisan tool kit,
- 2x randomized tools,
- 1x iron shiv,
- 1x lockpick

***** Tips for solving the mystery
Typically the activities mentioned fall into the following categories [study],
[trade], [relaxing], [family], and [entertainment]. You will need to talk to all
the travellers and figure out which one they report as the absolute worst to do
at the destination. If two activities are tied, one of them is unlikely to be
used as an alibi by anyone. Confronting and accusing the traveller who says
they're going there for this purpose will unlock a fight. The culprit will turn
hostile and try to kill you. Two ambushers will show up and assault the culprit
first, and you second. After winning the fight you can peacefully collect the
rewards.

At the type of writing, it is unclear if telling on the culprit will just fail
the event.

Once the event is over all travellers that have not been accused (you could
accuse the wrong one and fail the event) will offer a quest, similar to
commoners in towns.

***** Dude!

I wound up accusing someone based on nothing more than them saying they
wanted peace and quiet and were going to a place for the entertainment.

Mayhem ensued, loot dropped and in the end only the guy sitting the furthest
away from the action survived the assault by the accused's pals. three dead
to solve a robbery. wth! 

now the shivering sole survivor and inheritor of all the trashy loot i can't
haul away want to make funeral music with a clay triangle. a clay triangle!
one moment while i get him one..

wait! one body is missing. ah! one more survivor after all. he freaked out and
ran away.  good for him.
**** Unconscious Adventurer
- some are fakers,
- the others..
*** Locations
**** Castle
A noble of one of the factions lives inside here, protected by many guards and
assassins. You can /interact with the noble and complete missions to earn you
reputation with the faction they belong to. Rumour has it there might be
valuables if you should dare fight the whole castle.

- So far its been safe to salvage the throne for 1 iron.
- Don’t enter castles of the factions that don’t like you
  - seems like one wants to turn off the lights in there, perhaps even
    dismanteling the braziers and go in with dark-vision companions before
    killing everyone
**** Colliseum
Inside here you can find a champion to challenge. You have to enter alone, and
earn reputation and a lot of treasure if you can defeat the champion.

probably requires several pieces of masterwork equipment and some godlike stats
**** Dens
Inside you can find a legendary beast to fight.

- Unlit.
- Denizens have darkvision and, likely posess means to immobilize you.
- Crazy scout by 'move forward, throw lit torch and retreat' might let you
  trade a blight for a newly scouted monster. is that worth it?

**** Dungeon
A series of corridors and rooms, guarded by traps, ancient guardians and many
horrors lurking in the dark. In the first room there's an altar with a rune of
some element. You can find a lot of treasure inside. Remember to bring something
to light the way ahead and /mark the ground to not get lost.

- the ultimate adventure experience. these are why you invest time into the game
- waypoint outside and make camp there, bring foods, buffs, companions and rest well.

- You can peek in relative safety, remember though what killed the cat!
- Good help is hard to find, so don't judge the boss by his minions; 

I used to do /mark in dungeons before we had a local map, and before local
waypoints were a thing It was very very easy to get lost in there, and no way to
quickly exit

**** Fortress
- safe to salvage the doors for 6? ot 8? iron until you have picked a faction
- this is where you donate medals in exchange for reputation and access to traits
- dropping some walls/maybe buildings as one enters a hostile fortress and going
  with some meat-shields might work to get started on what may be the 'help thy
  faction' endgame. but idk. i will find out.
- word is that its ok to enter hostile faction fortresses.

**** Masterwork forge
- i remember hunting for these in the nightmare versions of 2019.
- these let you upgrade a (refined) and <artisan>'d item once more.

*** Just plain cool
Random things and places one might never see again..
- An Equestrian NPC riding a Gryphon
- An Island in the middle of a deep lake
- Rivers running through a map

**** Cow pasture
Found a serene pasture with a cow, a little lake, lots of flowers, and a
BigChest. I petted the cow a zillion times, fed her a flower and took her to
the nearest settlement.
**** A shrouded figure
Just that. Empty woods, Orange Square. Hollow eyes look at me and the figure
vanishes before I can inspect them. Spooky. Is he the guy taking all the kids I
can't find? Was he in one of the graves I dug up? What did I stumble on? I just
needed a wooden log! Should I dig there? /pug wonders on, then, wait! ..

Awakening as from a dream, he recalls the moment his memories began. There he
had seen that figure loitering over one of the bandits that keep coming after
him and his cow. Did that figure save him from a certain death? Is he somehow
connected to that society of researchers only elders seem to know about?
** Materials
Trying to pack all the info and stats about the things you craft with in here.

*** Wiki preamble
I sooo hope that the wiki/source is more than mostly right on this info
- source: https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Crafting_Materials

There is an abundance of different materials and most of them seem to be
associated with some kind of stat altering capabilities, that you can gain by
wearing or holding the item. In addition to the material you use when crafting,
the item you are crafting itself may have some base properties making up the
total attribute impact.

Weaponry, jewellery, and armour is made from wood, bone, scale, glass, and
minerals, while clothing items are made from cloths and furs - with a few
overlaps such as boots.

Note that at this time the precise number of stat pluses given by each material
is unknown, as it is not equivalent to the number of arrows a piece of equipment
has.

- (stat)> gives +1
- (stat)>> gives +2 or +3
- (stat)>>> gives +4, +5, or +6

Each additional nth arrow gives an additional n possible boosts (4 arrows giving
between +7 and +10, etc.)

#+end_example

Iron and Crystal are both uncommon. He gave back half of the same rarity,
rounded down, Charm doesnt matter to him it seems, would have seen it round
differently..
*** Trader
** Party
- Press "*p*" for party details. It will show you have many followers you have and
  can have. 
- Max party size appears to be class dependent.
- Make music to cheer up your party-member if they have a dark mood
  - Musical instruments much bigger than yourself can be held 
    to cheer up your party. It may be how how you look, or that you used */play*.
- Dancing is also a mood-booster. In some locations it winds up killing
  otherwise friendly NPC's who arn't [[FISHMONGER][Fishmongers]]. You'll know it when you see it.
  - Your stamina will return when you leave the map after dancing - but not that
    of your party member. Wait an hour "*>*" to let them catch their breath!
- Escort quests' escortees don't count against your party-size-limit.
- I like travelling alone in other games, in FARA i dont - yet.
- [[Talking][Talk]] to your pals to chat and control how they contribute in combat; at least
  a little bit.
*** Pets
Pet animals till they get ecstatic, then feed some stuff. If there's room in your party
they should join right away.

- Wild boars can be found in forests and they're absolute chads in combat
- Replace them with Grizzlies asap and upgrade from there
- Other bears are timid, they run away scared and sometimes pull animal
  attackers. after */exit* they come back. fun during the early days.

If you want to, say, have a private chat with the local nobles or hunt the
wumpus, i mean minotaur, then its good to know that you can dismiss your animal
pals from the party without them holding a grudge against you. If you want them
to rejoin you later you'll wish you had already dropped some food to bribe them
with right where you left them!

*** Mounts
- Saddles
- Enemy mounts, /inspect, not hostile, not tameable. attract new hostiles
  overnight!?

** Quests
You can figure these out by your self, don't sweat them. If there's trouble you
had to run from, kids or monsters or items and belongings you can't find, drop
the damn quest without penalty and get a new batch from the elder, the always
needy people of the realm and/or those workers you brought into your settlement.

Here are some really dumb observations about quests:

There are more types tied to specific locations. I need to add more info here.

*** Beastslayer you!
Listen man, I know you want to make a name for yourself, impress the Elder and
all that; Don't deny it, we've all been there. But let me give me you a hint
about this thing you dont want to ask about ... Those tracks you're looking for,
they have the beast's name in it and 9 out of ten times you find them in one of
the 8 directions just a single step away from the settlement. That other time,
you'll to take two steps to find them. 

See, I saw you pondering. Yep, that's why you couldn't find that monster the
other day. Now be careful reading the tracks!

*** Desperate Times
You know that times are desperate when almost overyone, no, make that everyone
you meet that's not out to kill you offers you ancestral heirlooms as rewards
for things you've never seen.

Needy as they are, they want foods that noone in their right mind would care to
eat, Weapons and other items you have never heard of. And they send you to
[[In the Crucible][unknown places]] too. Always they have needs in places you've never been, make you
deliver the weirdest trinkets or their odd selves to hard to find people
and places. The heirlooms from their illustrious ancestors, those medals,
just like their inane request never seem to run out.

Well, ok, some of the folks that you ferry between places are actually
interesting to talk to and would appear new to the game and a bit naive as
they just give you unique and valuable items that you can actually use.

Maybe you stumbled upon some underground railroad where people of different
factions are relocating all over the map because they are planning something.

(at this point pug starts dancing to cheer himself up.)

Ok, at least sometimes they had no idea they were paying waay too much for your
services.

*** Escort Quests
- seems you can always?/often? find a delivery and an escort, or two escorts
  with the same destination!
  - makes it doubly worthwhile to */slw* waypoint your npc so you can check what
    they want without keepingg too many notes by hand.

- escortees do not count towards the party limit.
  - for ex, with merc, pet and 2 escortees "P" showed '4 of 2'.
- probabably easier when started in the morning than at night
  - (well... if you're escorting guys stronger than yourself, then it might
    profit to travel at night for what seems is a greater chance at getting
    ambushed)
- tbd if escortees tolerate detours and or 'excessive' camping out.
- apparently they are a source of infinite custom/random weapons and gear
  - atm the wh crucible seems like a good place to keep those.
*** Missing Kid Quests
(from the notes of earlier pug.)

Stupid Kids! First you can never find them, then you do find one, and when you
bring them home in the middle of the night they want to play hide and seek and
you have to find them in 15 minutes or so. Totally Bogus! aaaargh.

Yet again you need to build a shelter. And you need search. At least without
either I've not found a single kid yet. Then you need to rest until morning so
you don't need to make light to find them again whence back in town and they
start playing their games. For that you need to have [[Trick out your map!][local waypoints]] by which to
move yourself through the settlement without going nuts. Do you have those?

And then you learn about how to make Burlap Dolls. Or perhaps they have that
very last exclusive item elite tier BP you had forgotten you wanted. I might
never learn what they are about cause I can't find the buggers!

Sometimes I find tracks leading to unknown dens instead of children. Are these
really just another type of innvitation to suicide myself?  Do i really need to
press "s" so that I */search* every square inch of the site? Or should I stop
being of attracting attention and just run around the location and */shout come
here*? Probably.

*** Suicide Quests
(excerpt from a letter by future pug.)

When you get to a new settlement a cheeky elder there is likely to invite you,
the stranger, to suicide by quest.

Accept then drop any kill-a-champion and other suspicious sounding quests after
visiting their locations without entering. Turn their game against them by going
there to scout for landmarks of interrest in the general area. Enter a few
random tiles nearby to look for 'who knows what' that spawned there!

Wait with the scary quests until you have legendary stats and artisan equipment,
or something close to that. Or wait until you are already thriving at a place
even further from Relica than where you first got the suicide invitations.

If you rush yourself, [[Blights][you'll die]]. Farawella!

** Runes

You need these things to create your own [[Spells][spells]].

Lots to fill in from the tooltips. I hope the lists are complete for now.

*** Effector Runes

If they are suffering from an effect, the caster is cleansed from these effects
when they cast the spell causing it. To make this work, casting Silencing is
possible even when you are silenced.

If you are burning, and don't have that spell, stop, drop and /roll.

**** Conditions
|--------------+---------------------------------------|
| Rune of      | Effect                                |
|--------------+---------------------------------------|

| Illumination | Receive more% Crit Hits, deny Stealth |
| Silencing    | Prevents casting                      |
|--------------+---------------------------------------|

**** Affecting Health & Stamina
|--------------+------------------------------------------------------|
| Rune of      | Effect                                               |
|--------------+------------------------------------------------------|

| Bleeding     | Drain %s Health                                      |

| Sickness     | Drain Stamina                                        |
|--------------+------------------------------------------------------|

**** Affecting Attributes
|------------------------+---------------+---------------|
| Attribute              | Raise         | Lower         |
|------------------------+---------------+---------------|
| [[Charm][Charisma]]               | Charm         | Uglyness      |
| [[Finesse][Finesse]], dash distance | Quickness     | Slowness      |
| [[Insight][Insight]]                | Enlightenment | Stupidity     |
| [[Resilience][Resilience]]             | Fortification | Vulnerability |
| [[Strength][Strength]]               | Rage          | Weakness      |
|------------------------+---------------+---------------|

Additionally,

|--------------+-----------------------------------------|
| Rune of      | Effect                                  |
|--------------+-----------------------------------------|
| Intoxication | Lowers [[Finesse][Finesse]], Raise chance to Stumble |
|--------------+-----------------------------------------|

**** Notes

- Forces are hugely useful, especially compared to other spells
  - I had a Thunder Force of Quickness in one run from a labyrinth
  - knocking people back 3 tiles for a relatively small stamina cost
    If you get rejuve on that, you're VERY good off


*** Stabilizer Runes

|------------+---------------+----------------------------------------------------|

| Shockwaves | AOE Status    | Inflicts 'slow' on targets in area                 |
|------------+---------------+----------------------------------------------------|


- ^1 description says "against all attackers", implying Melee, Magical and Ranged
  damage reflection even at high stats is said to not be all that great, but if 
  you can spare the spell slot, why not give it a go via an unelemental arcane 
  combined with Fury, Rejuvenation or an Attribute Effect.


**** All spells are created equal...
...Except beam, meteor, and barrage spells

*** Elemental Runes

Pick a number for the elemental runes you want to keep today and */salvage* the
rest to turn them into shards/dust. Rune shards and Medals are 'currency' in
this game. What you do with the "named runes" above is up to you. Salvage them I
would not.

|---------+-------------------------------------------------|
| Element | Heavy Attacks with Infused Weapons              |
|---------+-------------------------------------------------|
| Air     | Quickens Attacker/ +Finesse                     |
| Dark    | Darkens Target Mood/ -Stats                     |
| Earth   | Poison DOT, denies Healing, applies slowness ^1 |
| Fire    | Armor Damage                                    |
| Light   | Illumes Target/ +Crits                          |
| Water   | Heal Attacker                                   |
|---------+-------------------------------------------------|

- ^1 can/might/does also inflict bleeding.

If you infuse 2 runes into your weapon the effects alternate, halving your
healing potential.

See [[Damage Types][Damage Types]], Elemental, Attunement


*** Farming Runes

| /setkey 0 dig
| /setkey 9 takeall
| /setkey 8 craft crystal ingot

- at a beach. easy.
  - grants lot of crystal with the above keybinds
- setup a building to rest for buffs
  - because you will want to probably do this for a while
    and are likely to make several trips to Relica unless
    your inventory space is huge 
- what would be the ideal food/drink to take?
- enhanced iron shovel and workbench in inventory
- should be possible once you get the tool recipes from the first other settlement you visit.
- oh, have a rope on you while getting used to digging, just in case you slip and fall.
- must-read: [[Degritone's Guide to 100k Points]]
- see also [[If you're totally nuts, enhance you shovel.][If you're totally nuts, enhance your shovel]].

**** Dig and or Fish.. rather alike, no?
- haven't fished yet, so i can't quite compare

- Fishing with an iron fishing rod used to be viable for Fishmonger, but I spent
  an entire artisan iron fishing rod with Fishmonger and didn't get a single
  rune

**** Experiments
As a reality check on digging, I performed these experiments at a nice looking
beach 25km from home. The shack came in really handy during my travels since I
wound up with quite a few ingots and wound up sleeping there several times.

The results of my first/only two test runs are shown below.
The results surprised badly!


- counter-intuitive
- this trashes my understanding of the defintion of the stats
  - ought to determine the role of finesse in this if there is to be any hope of
    salvaging it

- 332 Crystal Ingots and 135 Runes richer, I'm not complaining.
- without notes and interruptions these numbers might take ~90mins?


** Settlements

- Well
- Fire Pit



*** Buildings & Staff
- transcribed from Relica by pug
- reminder, you only *need* the Warehouse at the start.
- don't compromise on gear to invest in buildings

**** Warehouse
"Gives access to a thing that helps you move to other settlements."

***** Cost
- 2 medals
- 20 wooden planks
- 10 ropes

***** Benefits
- Crucible that gives shared access to your stash of buffs, situational uniques,
  and supplies for expanding elsewhere.

- 6 Storage bins, probably best when only used in Relica, that let you get rid of
  things you dont want to see but dont want to loose. See [[Item Management]]

**** Stables
How!?@?#

***** Cost
- 2 medals
- 10 copper ingots
- 5 wooden buckets (got recipe after opening refinery)

***** Benefit
Aha's from looking at my first Stables.
Yours will be similar I'd think. So.. Oh!

- its a farm with spice and tree plots! 
  - a garlic and a fennel plot
  - a lemon and a maple tree plot
- farmer and stablemaster work here
  - there's also a young deer. should i bring the cow?
- also dropped a Starcloth and a Velvet Saddle
  - these materials i'd not seen before i opened the building


**** Tavern

***** Cost
- 2 medals
- 5 wooden stools
- 5 glass mugs

***** Benefit
- A Gambler that gives you 25% odds on scoring..
  - well.. so far all i got was this blue print
- A High level merc that wouldn't even talk to me yet
- A Well skilled merc that can hold his own
- A Damsel in distress NPC i escorted elsewhere

Have to check up on the patrons there again.
If all that got me was a gambling chance at BPs, fine!

**** Obelisk

***** Cost
- 2 medals
- 10 stones
- 25 runic shards

***** Benefit
The same damn obelisk you keep finding in the wilderness, but with a researcher
that offer runes for sale and who keeps the rock polished.

- Upgrade prices seem more reasonable at this installation than in the
  wilderness. Have to check!
- Single level upgrade obtained via Ruins become less attractice once you have
  this, but its hard to beat 'free and scary'.

***** Staff
The Arcane Researcher employed here, psychic and creative as he appears to be
gives you following 5 options to obtain a rune of "Something" from him for a
number of shards. These somethings could be:

|--------------+------+---------------------------------------|
| Something    | Cost |                                       |
|--------------+------+---------------------------------------|
| Destructive  |    3 | well, that's clear                    |
| Protective   |    3 | i can imagine that too                |
| Primordial   |    3 | that would have to be elemental runes |
| Supplemental |    2 | decide what that could be later       |
| Unknown      |    2 | <- But look at that!                   |
|--------------+------+---------------------------------------|

The first interaction I had with him was to buy something unknown of course. And
what I got wasn't a random thing, but a rune I had never seen before! Trying again
of course I got a very highly rated rune, the rune of spears. But I already had one
of thos in inventory. 

So I don't know. Did his psychic let him give me one kind of rune that I had never had
before then picking something destructive randomly? I'll have to solicit and wait for
feedback to get clear on that, or try it again in the next game. Respect!

- Consumes your excess resources.
- "Discovers" Recipes for Items you've been dying to find.

***** Notes
After, hmm, a little grinding, I got a bucket recipe allowing me to complete the
stables. That was nice. I also got a nice everburning? lantern that helps to
attract even more encounters at night

Here's a log of what he did for me in the beginning:

- each item cost 1 Medal
- all but the first item were of (Refined) Quality.

| Mat  | Qty | Result         |
|------+-----+----------------|
| bone |   1 | ball           |
| tin  |  20 | organ          |
| tin  |   5 | spear          |
| tin  |   2 | clip           |
| bone |   2 | bucket         |
| bone |   2 | grappling hook |
| bone |   2 | sign           |
| bone |   1 | goggles        |
| tin  |   1 | box            |
| tin  |   1 | lantern        |
| bone |     | lantern        |
| bone |     | violin         |

I might have missed an item there, but suddenly he asked for a crafted input,
turning *bone nunchucks > swordchucks*.

After he wanted the nunchucks he started asking for wooden blocks. Perhaps we're
coming close to a new materials tier after 12..13 runs.. Verry nice, very
grindy, very medal-expensive!

*3 wooden blocks > wooden anvil*

Afterwards he wanted bones again..

Anyway, now i can consult the [[Materials][Materials Tables]] and better versions
of his more sensible items. neat!

- Keeping these prototypes makes sense to me right now.

- Signs.. used to be terribly important in the old version i played. Perhaps
  they have a discoverable function..

- I guess I have to keep feeding him till he comes up with a pickaxe for mining!
** Skill Brackets

I have this notion that it might be possible to make a table that roughly
presents the words indicating enemy strength.. but I dont know. So I'm
collecting the word I find along the way in this table.


*TOTALLY GUESSING ATM!*

Feedback:
For NPC skill tiers, I've seen mercenaries with "mythical" and "ascended"
Not sure where that would fit in with legendary
- added the words, the guessing game continues.


** Spells
(expert info is on the way)

- See [[Obelisk]] for Spell-levels and leveling

Basically, you
- chose an elemental rune to determine what type of damage and what elemental
  effect it does,
- a “stabilizer” to determine what type of spell it is (long range, AoE, etc)
  and
- an effector rune to apply additional effects when you cast it (like blinding
  enemies, getting buffs on yourself, etc

More:
- Spell type + 2 elements + effect  adds random stabilizer
- If you don't use any elemental runes, only a stabilizer and effector, you get an arcane spell
- You can put 2 spells on weapons and armor.  (scrolls /use
- Curse spell + any damaging spell is a really good combo to get
- in case you want to know spear and blade are generally considered good spells

Shielding:
- Two elements (preferably including water)
  + rune of shields + rune of rejuvenation gives what I consider the best spell in the game.
- Because shield increases attunement to all elements, but does so more so for
  the elements included in its spell. This makes it so you can max an attunement
  with a shield of that element + 3(? 2? it's been a while since I played) runes
  on Masterwork equipment.

New:
- Okay, something I did discover is that you can make randomized spells with
  just elemental runes
- Think you can add a thing to document that?
- for ex:
  - Dark + earth rune 
    - example: "moon force - cast a force of earth and darkness to damage the target"
  - Two earth gave me a tome of earth shield, then an earth chain


*** Scrolls

If I was an [[ARTIFICER][Artificer]] I might know something about them. But I'm not. At this
point I just just them into a waterproof container in the warehouse for use in
Dungeons later on.

Doing that I've learned that there are scrolls that do and scrolls that teach.

Here's what I know about these

*** Spell-tombs
The second kind of is obviously better and rarer and I get the sense that the
someone who makes them was more likely to use his or her rarest runes on them so
that they could learn their complicated spells at will in the future. But as all
of the uncommon runes seem rarest to me at this point, I can't judge that right.

One day I'll crack the secret of that secret organization connecting the elders,
nobles and the shaded figure who at least saved my life if he didn't outright
summon me into this world..

*** You must have a healing spell
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b415a4ef-fd87-4008-9164-340d308713ad
:END:
- It's recommended to use a Rune of Rejuvenation
- More water attunement = more healing on water-infused-weapon heavies
- Rejuvenation is very powerful and you only seem to need a single rune to make
  a spell from it. (powerful subject to ..insert yeah long disclaimer here <g>)

**** Water Chain of Rejuvenation
I wound up making a "Water Chain of Rejuvenation" and upgraded it using Obelisk
Shards until it became "Flawless". Its not that great with my stats yet but it
doubles as an offensive spell which keeps enemies where they are while i heal a
little every turn for a few turns. It might be awesomer for a ranged class to
use chain spells, but its good enough to keep melee guys from ganging up on me
too badly.

I know you experts out there are saying to yourselves.. what an idiot, doesn't
he know.. and I want to stop you right there! I know its not perfect, but its
fine to have to drop an item from your pack if there's not anything else in
range for you to cast the chain on.

Anyway.. I had no shield runes when I made the spell 50 days ago. And I still
don't have one, nor did I get another rejuvenation rune since. So if you like
hoarding to figure things out, try not to be stupid about it, these things are
meant to be used .. and you can always spend a week fishing and digging at a
beach. I will ;)


** Weaponry

See Mishaal's FARA Compendium for weapon details
and his growing Item list!
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TK8xF1WbIa_C2U8MkLYVoELI1V3aNUsllLEzgZfX5vg/edit?usp=sharing

- The main difference between weapons is only in their heavy attack and the stat
  they scale with.

- Most combat RNG was removed (anything that says "chance to..." is probably no
  longer a thing).

- Need to identify/doc/present by primary attribute instead of presenting it
  like this.

- Kris inflict poison and khopeshes disarm attackers if THEY try to do a heavy

I've seen some talk about stats that track well-used and newly-used weapons
being different somehow somewhere, the info being in a hidden stat. Please write
if you can fill in the details!


*** Melee
|-------------------+----------------------------|
| Axes              | may cleave                 |
| Bladed weapons    | may cause bleeding         |
| Blunt weapons     | may cause dazed            |
| Spears and chains | have increased range       |
| Spears and pikes  | have higher chance to crit |
|-------------------+----------------------------|

*** Magical
|----------------------------+--------------------|
| Foci/wands/staffs/scepters | halve casting time |
|----------------------------+--------------------|

- Focus HeavyAttack? causes the wielder to phase backwards
- Foci/wands/staffs/scepters are ranged weapons with 6 range. In addition to
  reducing stamina costs of spells, their heavy attacks all have unique effects
- Scepter reduces direct spell damage taken during the attack
- Staff reduces target's attunement
- Wand causes the weapon to inherit elements from incoming spells

*** Ranged

|----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bows           | have a chance to not break stealth                               |
| Crossbows      | bolts pass through targets, potentially hitting several targets. |
| Firearms       | possibly interrupts casters; indoors less than outdoors.         |
| Nets           | (may) immobilize when thrown                                     |
| Thrown weapons | do extra damage, and may take damage.                            |
|----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------|

- Also shortbow causes the wielder to leap backwards after firing

- The material used for ammo contributes to damage and the chance for it to
  break on impact.

- Attack speed was removed, now each attack takes one turn regardless of
  weapon - likely making quivers and bandoliers (which gave the speed boni)
  largely cosmetic/flair items.


* Pug's Notes
Look, I wrote this!

** The Ages

As you will see later in this guide there are several tiers of materials in
FARA. And for argument's sake lets call the main material you're using and
finding, equivalent to being in an age.

You'll be able to survive many if not most of the random encounters near Relica
with relative ease since the Amateur opponents you meet so close to the hub of
lowest difficulty don't have equipment better than yours.

Spending time near Relica allows you to not just learn the game but collect any
number of recipes for later use since your ability to re-craft anything you find
using materials is unmatched. Getting these materials, learning the nuances of
your gear and how to enhance it properly lets you you advance advancing to
somet like a later age.

** The Magic

As you find your basic stats and damage resistance risen to something like 'the
iron' age Magic, that is elemental attacks become more of an issue for you.

Enter the elemental resistance which you now learn to give to your gear by
applying runes to it. Letting these get to average and better is quite a 
challenge and a profound mystery at first.

You have access to elemental runes that you can apply to your gear, situational
food and drink providing buffs, even a Commander Level Faction Trait to help
resist the most devious of enemies!

** Trick out your map!
Use */setlocalwaypoint* aka */slw* at your spawn, at every house, donation
chest, and every last npc on the map. Greet NPC's and put their names into the
waypoint name. You'll be glad you did!

There are several buildings of which you'll want to expand at least the
warehouse within the first few weeks game-time. It offers a way to access quite
a bit of stuff from elsewhere. A local waypoint at the spawn and on the
warehouse donation chest will save you a lot of time.

"*W*" makes zooming around the local map quick and convenient. That is unless
there are doors, pets, npc, or even the well along the path. Its not perfect yet
but "*W*" is a huge help. Use */slw* until it becomes a habit.

** Item Management

Where you keep your stuff is up to you!

But there's one thing you have to know: *WARNING* NEVER LEAVE ANYTHING ON THE
SPAWN tile! FARA's advanced teleportation mechanism creates an intense rush of
air as your body materializes -- and that scatters anything you might have left
there through the immediate area. Try it out.

Anyway, I'm still learning to play the game and I have yet to win. But this is
my second run at it in 3 years and I find that starting as a horder with a base
in Relica is again teaching me what I don't need or want, and how to deal with
everything else. Here's the scoop on what works for me.

*** InShelter

**** Update!

After thriving for 132 days I'm ready to leave this layout behind.

I worked beautifully. I used just two storages and was able to do get in 
and out very quickly. But now that I *want* storages I'm make the warehouse
into Pug's house and place 8 storages around the crucible. This frees up a
workbench and allow the main problem with this layout -- the escortees that
I wound up bringing into relica to no longer cramp my style. Mind you, they
go their own way after you're not in town for a while, but its better this
lest I give another precious item to them or the elder by accident.

So as last night, this is the concept:

| Woody     | Clothy     | Foody  |
| Metally   | *Crucible* | Tooly+ |
| Undecided | Beddy      | Runy   |

- Woody/Clothy/Metally play together really well because of the number of items
  that wind up in these storages.

- Foods has the Booze, Honey, Eggs, Meats, Venoms, Feathers, Nests and Beehives.
- Tooly all my "{<(Equipment)>}", all Shards, Medals, Lights, Lockpicks &
  Elemental Runes.
- Runy all the Effect and Stabilizer runes
- Beddy, a bed and useless flavor trinkets such as towel, blanket, pillow,
  a stuffed fuzzy doll, and all the Balls of wax and yarn a real hero needs.
- Undecided holds Gear and ammo for what will be my mercs. I'm still happy
  with my grizzly atm.

This leaves huge piles of crystals & leather and the problem of cooked foods.

I've not worked it out, but there will be 8 firepits and some kind of sensible
way of dealing with buff/food preparation further south in the warehose.

Remains to be seen what if any kinds of walls I wind up putting in there and
if I'm not going to play house some more by putting bed and brazier by the 
door in the south, as in:

| warehouse |                                                   |
| top 3rd   | Piles and items of usefulness around the crucible |
| middle 3d | "The Kitchen" - Fires, piles                      |
| bottom 3d | "Living area" with Crystal+ Furniture             |

with the top looking like so:

| Clothy     | Woody      | Metally     |
| NamedRunes | *Crucible* | Tooly+Elems |
| StatFood   | ElemFood   | OtherFood   |

TBD. I already have more functional ideas..

- also colors..

**** Initially

I build a 7x7 house around the elder and the spawn point, so i'm close to my
piles, quests and right next to a bed, a brazier and the door for the most
restful healing sleep in every settlement I open.

*THIS* is incredibly useful with local waypoints and I get a lot of mileage out
of it! The base layout takes 23 planks, 4 braziers (8 rocks) and a door (2
wooden blocks)

In Relica I use this arrangement:

| Brazier | Runy        | -     | Booze   | Brazier |
| -       | *The Elder* | -     | -       | Fruits  |
| Woody   | Clothy      | Buffy | -       | Seeds   |
| Metally | *Spawn*     | -     | -       | Flowers |
| Brazier | Bed         | -     | Storage | Brazier |

- A workbench to the left of the spawn
- Clothy has all the animal parts as well
- In the Storage: Alternate items of awesomeness, a spare sack.
- Under the Storage: Ammunition, Lockpicks, Ropes, Medals, Shards

I have a /setkey for "/drop 8" and find using that and moving around quite effective
to get the excess out of my inventory most of the time. 

- Runy has a storage for named runes and is a dump for elemental runes
- The bed still needs a blanket and a pillow.

I started replicating this elsewhere but wound up just sleeping in the house
(useful!) and dumping things around the outpost warehouse crucibles.

***** Feedback on the home office
This can be condensed quite a bit
I'd say first of all that it should be simple things

"Misc" "Materials" "Equipment" "Food" "Runes" "Valuable"

That condenses Woody + Clothy + Metally and Buffy + Booze + Fruits + Seeds + Flowers

Second of all, the brazier layout is bad (I think) because last I checked
brazier light is blocked by item piles (which sucks)

*** Warehousing

Unlock this Building ASAP!

"There is nothing in any of my warehouses .. except in Relica's." - pug.

First off, I don't really like the slow interaction with the storage bins in the
warehouse. 

Instead of holding an item-stack to put it into the the number 1 position and 
typing */giveall*, I */give #x* if its a single item and drop whatever stacked
item right on top of the bins.

I dont use scrolls but I keep them in a bin next to the crucible because I
already know that I will be desperate for them when I'm strong enough to get
myself into the best part of the game I know, dungeons! (Please don't read that
to mean that my avatar is mindless about hoarding. After all, some scrolls were
meant to be /salvaged and he's read enough of this guide to know that!)

Sure, as player, I could */salvage* everything, but my avatar isn't wired like
that. He keeps fancy but not the fanciest kites, beehives, birds-nests, folded
notes, toyswords and other things like that for flavour. Once in the warehouse,
but these things are out of sight, not out of mind.

After opening up the (Refinery) I wound up with oddities like Tin Fiddles and
Organs, Bone Spears and Goggles. I love the recipes, but instead of salvaging
them right I stash away the Smith's output in the warehouse get an insight into
what he's doing, knowing full well that the stash doubles as a rune-shard hoard.

Ammo. I got tons of ammo of all kinds. When I get a new ranged weapon I try them out
and keep the nicest ones in a Storage box on which i all dump all spare ammo. I find
that much easier than placing stacks into the box.

But listen, before you stash anything you find or loot, beat-up and or salvage
the whatever because especially among the items you find on trees, surprises await!

**** People who have seen more of the game know better things than dungeons!
How cool is that?

Check out this feedback: Dungeons! It's anything but "best"; It's an hour spent
fumbling around in a dark maze trying to find a key and a door, dealing with
stealthed enemies, and hidden traps! Dungeons are not the best part of the
game. At all.

To a long-time player of rogue-likes, that's an endorsement! and a promise for
even better! <g>

**** Thanks for paying attention!
If you did, you will enjoy this random secret!

- Peacocks drop an item that gives you *FIN>>*
- Its kinda like the one with the milk :)

*** In the Crucible
For taking with me when traveling to a new settlement:
| 2 medals |
| 10 ropes |
For setting up the next house:
| 4 wooden logs | building planks and door        |
| 8 rocks       | i like my braziers made of rock |
For the next house, but also trips to the beach/lake/graveyard:
| 1 bed       |
| 1 workbench |
Always in the Crucible
| Dishes           |
| Meals            |
| Mixtures         |
| Sensible Uniques |

Once */place* takes a count we'll all be able to do a whole lot more with that
ingenious invention!

*** In General

- consider carrying a container with water so you can boost your stamina
  in an emergency.

- consider carrying a rope or a kite whenever you take a shovel out for a dig
  to avoid getting hurt should the ground give way under your feet.

- lights are useful to trigger encounters at night, insure that you the full
  attention of legendary beasts living in dens, lighting your way in that
  labyrinth you are too proud to exit, and for finding out "what's down there"
  when you eventually lie, legs broken, in that cave you dug into.

As with backups of your computer, there are two kinds of people in the world,
people who carry backups, and people who will.

** Moving out and on
Again, complete the warehouse before you change settlement or do escort quests.
When you go take 2 medals and 10 ropes with you to quickly complete the
warehouse in your new place right away when you get there.

You'll also enjoy having spare a workbench, a bed and the materials you need for
the next house at the new locale's spawn already in the crucible.

** Upgrades

In each new settlement you reach you will find a set of tools to enhance your
equipment's performance.. Search for them and you shall find these craftable
gems.

But don't rush. Form a party, discover things and get settled and strong-ish.

After a while you and your party can handle all the kill quests the elder hands
out, and you'll likely have a couple of waypoints to other settlement and NPC's
eager to see you killed while you escort them there. When you are ready to look
for those tools and recipes accept the escort and delivery quests to that new
locale and leave right after waking up from resting.

Once you found them and are done marveling at your good luck from arriving
alive, getting a unique item and finding the tools, make sure to /inspect, not
/salvage them.

You can enhance the equipment of the proper type for your class which
you will have discovered, equipped and understood by now, or ..

*** If you're totally nuts, enhance you shovel.

After settling into the the new place, find a beach and grind runes in style.

Plan to stay at the beach/dig-site for a while. Put up a 5x5 with door and
brazier for the good-morning buff and go rune hunting in safety close to
home.

When you can make a second workbench, then when you have runes for rejuvenation
and/or other spells go back to 'questing with the elder' until you have at least
several iron pieces or whatever is best for your needs.

Take your workbench when you dig so you dont need to make repair kits. Your
enhanced shovel will stay sharp that way. If you get bored digging, repeat the
racket with a fishing-rod while staying in the same shelter. Perhaps you'll even
put up a fire-pit for some extra 'positive outcome boosting' charisma buffing
snacks! Oh, and have a rope on you, just in case.

I've heard that noone will mind if you dig up a graveyard from end to end dolled
up in your finest charisma boosting gear either. But I'll let you try it first!
Maybe after your next escort quest?

Shovel or Fishing rod, what do i know. Plus I'm [[Charm][dubious about iron]] as
a [[Materials][material]] for either!

** Traveling

We all know your avatar's a bit sensitive and often drops down to the local
level because they sensed danger or spotted some cockroaches fight one another.

If the circle is blank of enemies, or you can make it so with a few steps away
from the fight, do that! more often than not "*X*" */exit* or clicking on your
waypoint will take you out and put you back on the road!

And hey, if "*X*" fails, it will have moved you to the action without you having
to look for it. This is really helpful if you cast a shield on yourself before
doing do, esp. if your're traveling at night, yet again without a light.

As you're travelling you'll find more info about [[Skill Brackets][Skill Brackets]]. Please
share.


** Exploring

New Location?

|Move|Until
|SW x4|sw border comes into view
|NW x5|lhs borders look the same
|NE x10|top borders look the same
|SE x8|rhs borders look the same
|SW x10

Besides doing quests, I attempt to explore in a circle of ever greater distance
from Relica and by manually taking different paths through the rectangles
connecting settlements.

Keeping Relica in the center makes investing into it somewhat viable and
worthwhile, at least i think so atm. At least thats why I use the warehouses to
let all trinkets/trophies/seeds/flowers/meats/fruits drift back into Relica
through the crucibles accessed via local waypoints.

People in the advanced stages of the game talk about traveling 1200++ km from
relica, fighting unheard of monsters from unheard of dimensions while still
investing into Relica. So as you explore more of these notes keep in mind that
I'm just starting, know nothing, have yet to win the game and go beyond iron
equipment and a single godlike attribute. This game has great depth and
complexity.

** Difficulty

FARA's difficulty is a gem. Yes, really. I don't know the formula, but like you,
I appreciate that the things you encounter in your travels seem to slowly get
harder. These things seem to matter:

- the further from Relica you are,
- the further away you have been,
- the more challenging the enemies you have ended,
- the better equipped/longer you have been in game,
- the more titles (achievments?) you have.
- WHAT ELSE?

But unlike most games, FARA doesn't actually seem to be out to kill you as it
did in (what to me were) 'the nightmare versions' released some years ago.

Combat in FARA can be freaky cool, and as long as you prioritize survival over
your macho, you'll manage to escape and appreciate the insurance that having
even a single gulp of [[Liquids][water]] with you for that one time where its quicker to
drink and dash than it is to walk. But there's always [[The Burning House][this]].

** Finding things in daylight vision

Small things on the ground can be seen up to 5 spaces away in a straight line,
but only 3 spaces diagonally. This is true in town and in wilderness maps.

Thus if you're looking for flowers or lost items you can move in paralell lines
11 spaces apart, that means there are 10 spaces between your lines.

*** example in town:
**** step 1
move 5 right and down from the top left. there are now 5 spaces between you and
the edge. use */mark <color>* on a that square, then move all the way to the
right until there are 5 spaces between you and the edge. use */mark <color>*
again and take 2 steps to the NE so you see into the very edges of the
map. */mark <color>* all those points 3 and 5 away from the map corners to
remember.
**** step 2
from the top-left, on a marker with 5 spaces between you and the edges, move
down until the marker just disappears and place another marker. repeat until
you're at the bottom.
**** step 3
starting at your favorite marker in the top left corner, again mark spots with
10 spaces between them going to the right.
**** step 4
now project the outside marks -- 5+1+10= -- to 16 spaces from the edges and you'll
begin to see exactly where to place markers to make paths that guarantee search
quest succeed quickly and consistenly.
**** [step 5]
when you walk around a new town for the first time setting up your */slw* local
waypoints, instead of only grabbing all the loot, place 4 markers inside the
houses that leave 3 spaces between them and the walls. this makes it easy to
remember that you only have to step on each of them once to have scanned
everything. (you can can optimize that a bit, but this is good enough.)
** Climbing
I'm pre-repeating myself here so we are clear that */climb* lets you */dance/*
on that table you just dragged to the middle of town. It's a good thing you
should use to get a view from the trees you */harvest* and it might even let you
see a little further. But I don't think it helps you find small lost objects or
those hard to find small rare species you'll inevitably be tasked with
researching. Then again I'd not thought about planting trees in strategic
locations around town.. until now :)

* Playing
** /COMMANDS

*If you find that your game slows down when moving around, issue /clearlog* 

- */help* gives most of them
- */settings* gives more of them
- The [[Release Notes][Release Notes]] give insights into and context for additional commands.
  Click the link and search for "*/*"

The discord's spoiler channel denizens often refer to 'creative mode' and yet
more */commands* but i haven't had the patience or desire to slug through the
jargon there. One seems to need to tap into the voice channel and speak to
people in order to obtain basic information about much of the game still.

If this bothers you as it does me .. because it keep out new players that will
give brian love and some money .. then *use this month of april'21* to send me
even just a single fact on the discord channel to add to this text before I'm
likely to fade into the void again!

- */split* operates on the selected item, give it a parm for how many items you
  want in a new pile

- *If you happen to be on fire, (stop, drop and) /roll*

** KEYS!
- read the bottom of */keybinds* aka "*K*"
- use *Home/End* to scroll through help and other popup windows!
- remember */exit* aka "*X*" to leave a map.

suggestions:

| /setkey ; layout{1,2} |
| /setkey : layout3     |
| /setkey , autoloot    |
| /setkey < climb       |
| /setkey k clearlog    |

- layout3 is like turbo mode for moving in the game; i love it. switch back to
  layout1 or layout2, whatever you like best, as needed using the non-shifted
  key.
- you want autoloot off at home, so keep it off and use situationally.
- climbing a tree before bumping into it occasionally gives kites, beehives,
  birds nests, maybe even a lost toy sword; all things you can drag home
  and exhibit to impress your npc buddies.


- *z* is really cool for */place* ing items into containers */give* ing items and
  many more things. you can press it multiple times before the game reacts and
  it will do the right thing.

But, *be careful when using the /z shortcut!!!*

It repeats only most 'last typed (not shortcut) commands' which gives it the
ability to surprise you in unexpected ways!. If you're not sure what you typed
last, type / then press "up arrow". Not that that would save you from surprises
though.

** Talking

Unless you are a [[WILDHEART][Wildheart]] you can talk to your pets and /say or /shout whatever
it is you want, and they won't listen. That is unless you are a [[CAT WHISPERER][Cat Whisperer]] 
and have managed to recruit one of these marvels.

Normal people however can only talk to other people, and it's only the Mercs 
you've recruited into your party that will listen to and obey you.

- use */say wait here* and */say follow me* to control your party members. you
  don't have to ask them to come along when you leave the map, they will do that
  by themselves.

- Also:
  - /say stow your X
  - /say draw your X
  - /say take that X
  - /say stand by that X

- An exclamation mark turns /say into /shout

- use */shout come here* when searching for people.
  (repeat with "*z*" as you walk around.)

There's probably some (much?) more to say and other banter to be had. Many of
the options seem to make the most sense for a [[POLITICIAN][Politician]] however.

Weird fact: Mercs will sometimes say things and other NPC not in your party will
speak back to them. Thats freaky cool.

Weirder link about upperercase for extra loud shouting! http://tom7.org/lowercase/

** Random Notes from Discord

-> PASTE NEW THINGS HERE

The first batch swiped 2021.04.06ish by scrolling backward in time a few months
is mostly distributed into this document already.

These I grabbed recently. Who knows how much more great insight and conversation
has been lost in the sands of time because.. documentation isnt spoilers, its
what lets other people have fun and what you'll want when you come back in a few
years. .. anyway ..

A few things regarding charged rift particles:
- First, you can create one by dropping one of each elemental rune and making a spell. This still is very painful, but it won't destroy your stuff and doesn't require an inert rift shard.
- Second, on one recent run I found a commoner with a quest to procure a "rift beacon." Turns out you build this using CRPs.
- Apparently, they're able to summon Redeemed Rift Beasts which don't appear to be limited by the party size limit
- Probably the stats of the Redeemed Rift beasts scale of distance away from relica
- They seem to have a days survived stat that's always equal to yours, no matter when you summoned them.
- I wonder where you could find the recipe for the RB
- it's kind of busted for castle raiding
- No idea. Might try feeding Relica's blacksmith until they hit on the recipe. That's how I got a gold ingot recipe.
- Trader chests also sometimes come with recipes
- Maybe take 3 CRPs to a Summoning Circle?

*** what classes do yall like the most

*Ent, twice more* prefers
  - Pugilist > Viking > Soldier.                        

*Mantecar* likes to say
  - For me, it's Swiftshade/Merchant.
    
*Mishaal* decided
  - Scholar's very versatile
  - I've only played with a limited number, but for me its the scholar!

and Pug survives
  - as a Gatekeeper.
** Obsolete/Guides
*** Degritone's Guide to 100k Points
Written by a master of the game for an old version, some relevancy remains
from: https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Degritone%27s_Guide_to_100k_Points
**** Note
This works best with *Pugilist*, *Viking*, or *Soldier*.

Results may vary with other classes, and would not work for spell-based builds
or Artificer. Additionally, this guide assumes you already know a little bit
about FARA.
**** Guide
Get the quest to go to Relica and go, then immediately abandon any kill
quests. Inspect then salvage every wooden object in Relica except the closest
door to the elder. Take the glass mug. That house will be your home base. /craft
workbench and drop it and all of your wooden blocks and hero medals in a corner
of your house.

Fill up your glass mug, sleep in your house (remember to close the door,) then
do easy quests and waypoint anything you come across while traveling to look at
monsters or find children. Also, salvage any equipment and runes you don’t care
about and put the resources on your workbench pile. Repeat this until you find
at least 2 fortresses.

When you come across a *Will of the Wild Fortress*, interact with the officer and
give them at least 10 medals. Interact with the Tactician and take the first 2
minor traits on the list.

Salvage all iron doors in every fortress you know of and hoard them on top of
your workbench. Continue doing easy quests until you have some copper or better
equipment, including a tower shield, and enough medals to make the total medals
given to Will of the Wild 100.

Go to the WotW Fortress with your medals and give them medals so you have max
rep with them in the /factions screen. This should take 100 total medals,
including the initial few you gave, though it will take more if you killed any
WotW staff.

Once you do that, take Analyzer (replacing the trait other than Plunderer) and
inspect all your copper (or better) equipment. You can now make iron versions of
that equipment. Do so.

How many runic shards do you have right now? Is it less than 266? /craft
dowel. /craft wooden shovel. /craft wooden repair kit. Find a beach. Dig (/dig)
once on each tile, picking up every rune that spawns. With a wooden shovel, you
can dig 16 times before you need to use your repair kit to fix your shovel. This
number will be lower if you use a non-wooden repair kit to repair the shovel.

If your shovel is orange, don’t dig again. If your wooden repair kit is broken,
find a pile of clay and /craft clay repair kit. A clay repair kit will give you
less digs per use, but is easy to produce.

Repeat this until you have enough runes to salvage to get you to 266 runic
shards, plus an additional Rune of Rejuvenation and Rune of Shields. Drop all
the other runes in your inventory and use the salvage all command (usually the 7
key, but may be a different key if you’re targeting something) until all the
runes are shards. Take those shards back home to your huge pile of stuff.

Make a Shield of Rejuvenation of a dual element of your choice (I recommend at
least using water in the shield, however) by dropping the Rune of Shields, the
Rune of Rejuvenation, and 2 elemental runes of your choice (and no other runes)
on the same tile, then doing /makespell. Learn this spell.

Go to the WotW Fortress and take the Fabricator trait, replacing Analyzer. Go
back home and craft 7 Reinforced Tools and 7 Artisan tools. Use the Reinforced
tools on your equipment, then go to the WotW Fortress once more and take the
Forgemaster trait.

Use your Artisan Tools on your equipment. Put water runes on three of your
equipment and 2 of everything else on your equipment, excluding your weapon. You
only put water on your weapon because it's healing every heavy attack. Putting
any extra runes on the weapon would cause the healing to be every other heavy
attack, effectively halving your healing.

Finally, craft enough Sturdy Plates to get you to Godlike RES and slap those on
pieces of your equipment that aren’t your weapon. Your weapon should have an
Arcane Sigil, which must be found (Tool Chests are useful for this.) The
remaining slots are your choice. FIN is useful for stealth, INS for lowering
your Ward’s cost, STR for getting it to godlike, and CHA for increasing your
Ward’s and Rejuvenation’s duration.

Congratulations, you’re pretty close to immortal. Remember to use your Ward of
Rejuvenation before starting a fight, rather than after, and to heavy attack
twice when you’re able in order to heal. If you’re low on health, enter a safe
location, use your Ward of Rejuvenation, and walk around until the rejuvenation
wears off, then cast it again. Repeat until full health.

The only things that can realistically threaten you are your own stupidity,
Ruins if you aren’t careful, and potentially some spoiler monster. Though, this
assumes you don’t walk too far from Relica. I haven’t seen what kind of damage
output exists thousands of km away from Relica.

So, go crazy (except around Ruins. Be careful there.) Kill whatever. You’ll get
significantly more points if you get key fragments, so go get them. Castles are
easy sources, since you can just kill all the guards in the noble’s room, then
kill the noble for a fragment, then stealth away.

Be sure to use any Obelisk Shards you get to upgrade your Shield of Rejuvenation
to Flawless.

Once you get the key, start eating fragments with /cast conversion. Only eat one
at a time, and only after you get your 10th fragment. This maximizes points per
fragment by making you get key completion points every time you get a
fragment. Using conversions on godlike stats is wasteful, but otherwise, use
them on whatever you want. It’s just a matter of time until you have 100k+
points.

**** 2021.03.27 FARA Alpha 16: Blightborn is LIVE!
Well met, travelers!
Public Alpha 16 is here, and with it come some HUGE changes to the core mechanics of FARA. Combat and dying have been overhauled, and many other facets have been adjusted with the goals of encouraging exploration and smoothing game progression. I want to give a special thanks to the volunteers in our awesome Discord community for testing these changes over the last month. FARA is so much better because of your thoughtful feedback and gigantic brains. The notes presented below are but a fraction of what this update has to offer. FARA is a game about exploration after all, so I encourage you to start a new adventure and discover all the new goodies for yourself!



***** BLIGHTS:

This update adds a little more flair to the concept of permadeath with the introduction of the Blight mechanic. Instead of immediately perishing when dealt a killing blow, you now have the option to be resurrected with a permanent difficulty modifier. These modifiers, or blights, range from stat reductions to increased encounter rate. You have the option to accept a blight every time you die, but the chances of successfully resurrecting are lowered based on the number of blights you have.

As FARA grows in scope and presents new long-term progression options for players, the idea of permadeath as it existed seemed harsh and out of place. With the blight system, players should feel more empowered to explore and grow with the same character without the threat of their first mistake completely wiping out all of the time and resources they've invested in their worlds.



***** COMBAT:

- Variable speeds for most combat actions have been removed, making combat feel more turn-based. For every action you perform, all other combatants will also perform a single action.

- Added a /dash action. Dashing allows entities to move across multiple tiles in a single moment at the cost of stamina. Max dash distance is determined, among other factors, by Finesse. Dashing can also be performed by holding Shift and using the arrow keys. Releasing the Shift key will perform the dash.

- Added ~10 new unique heavy attack effects, including unique effects for Insight-based weapons

- Swapping two held items is now a free action which does not use a turn.

- Weapon size no longer plays a role in damage output or speed.

- Heavy attack stamina usage is now determined by the wielder's proficiency in the weapon's 'needed' stat.

- Reduced the duration of most effects, buffs, and debuffs by ~75%. Because of the changes to action speed, effects still expire at roughly the same point in a combat encounter.

- Most common damage-over-time effects now tick every moment instead of every ~5. Because of the duration reductions, they still deal about the same amount of total damage.



***** EXPLORATION & CRAFTING:

- Added some new items and NPCs in settlements to aid in resource management and exchanges

- Removed hunger and thirst

- Increased the likelihood of finding items and NPCs of interest when exploring local areas

- Reduced encounter chance when moving on the world map

- Common enemies now have a chance to drop crafting resources

- Increased starting inventory size from 20 to 25

- Increased Hidden Pocket inventory bonus from 2 to 5

- Simplified the crafting requirements of many weapons and tools

- Increased the material cost Workbenches and gave them the ability to repair all personal items at once

- Removed a big chunk of the starting recipes and dramatically increased the likelihood of finding items/recipes you don't have



***** CLASS CHANGES:

- Illusionist: Removed Blink spell and replaced it with Prestige, an ability which allows the caster and target to switch places

- Juggernaut: Their /dash causes damage to encountered obstacles



***** NEW LAYOUT OPTIONS:

- Added 2 new interface layout options which can be enabled with /layout2 (also known as /bigmap) and /layout3. They can be particularly helpful for those who wish the minimap was larger:

Layout 1 (default):
Layout2:
Layout 3:


***** MISCELLANEOUS:

- Made some substantial engine optimizations. The game should run much, much better in crowded environments.

- Mouseover tooltips can now be disabled with /tooltips.

- Arcane Obelisks in settlements now have infinite uses.

- Autoloot is now enabled by default. If you've played FARA before, you might need to manually turn this setting on with /autoloot, or via the /settings menu.

- FINALLY updated some of the outdated information under /help and /define

- Fixed a crash caused by butchering fish

- Fixed an issue with blight spells (now called plagues) lasting forever

- Fixed a crash caused by /define

- Fixed all sorts of typos

- Added new typos



As is the case with every update regardless of size, starting up a new adventure is strongly recommended over trying to load an older save. In this case, trying to load anything older than 0.0.16 won't even work.

Good luck out there, travelers!


*** Alpha 15 Dec'20..
**** 2021.02.13 Patch Notes
- Removed several unfinished settlement facilities. They will make a return when they actually do something. For now, every settlement has the same 5 facilities, and they are always in the same style of building.
- Finished the Warehouse facility
- Added a /recipe 'itemname' command which lists the components of a specified known recipe. Can also be performed with /rcp.
- Added a /deletetitle command for permanently removing earned titles from the /factions window
- Added 'Repair' as a mouse menu option when possible
- Updated castle Nobles to fall more in line with the quest behavior of settlement Elders. One notable difference is that the completion or failure of noble quests will affect faction reputation. For now, the quest types are the same ones you know and love, with the goal of having faction-specific quest types in the future.
- Inspecting bags now unlocks recipes for the next size/type of bag.
- The /repair command can now utilize Repair Kits on the ground as long as they're within reach.
- Made unknown landmarks more obvious when traversing the world map
- If you've been having input issues and have a game controller connected to your computer, you may now use /ignorecontrollers to (hopefully) fix any problems.
- Typing '/inspect all' will now inspect all items on your target list. Each inspection still counts as a complete action, and the sequence will be interrupted if you take damage.
- Updated the criteria for which character deaths/retirements are announced on Discord
- The character sheet now properly shows attunements after death
- Fixed a long-standing issue with NPCs taking 1 more moment than the player to perform any action. The fix for the this was suspiciously easy, so I'm positive I've broken something. Let me know what you find!
- Fixed a bug which prevented Traders from working as intended
- Fixed a bug which prevented the /autosave setting from persisting after reload. Note, this is different from the forced saves that take place after certain game events. Forced saves cannot be disabled.
- Fixed several instances of jank looking fireworks when /bigmap is enabled
- Fixed several instances of map cursors lingering longer than they should
- Fixed an issue which prevented the manifestation of a second minor trait if you had a major trait
- Fixed an issue with cavern entities such as chests and nodes crowding the cavern entrance instead of being spread throughout the cavern.
- Fixed a game crash caused by the Giant Swing ability
- Fixed an issue with certain entities not showing up on the target list at the proper distances
- Fixed a bug which caused several craftable items to be described as 'wood' when they weren't
- So many optimizations

**** 2021.02.10 Patch Notes
- Repair Kits are now stackable, single use, and have a different recipe.
- Added a /repair command which will use a Repair Kit on a specified item
- Arguments for the /targetfilter command can now be preceeded with a '-' to exclude certain results, i.e. '/targetfilter -tree' will filter out all trees from the target list.
- Fixed some crashes related to items which are no longer available
- Fixed NPC Politicians not being able to use their ability
- Fixed some display issues with the health and stamina bars

**** 2021.02.09 Patch Notes
- Harvested plants now slowly regenerate over time.
- The /drop command now defaults to inventory items instead of held items
- Restored /screenshake to its former glory
- Scaled down the map size when /bigmap is enabled to show more of the game log
- Removed several redundant weapon types
- Replaced the myriad of repair kits with a single item called a Repair Kit
- All settlements now have warehouses
- Re-added the accidentally deleted auto-loot setting
- Fixed an issue with resting until morning jumping ahead too far when performed at certain times
- Fixed a huge bug with /sort that caused it to mangle up all kinds of game data
- Fixed a bug which caused offhand ranged attacks to use the attack power of the mainhand weapon
- Fixed issue with missing log message for dropped items
- Fixed several display issues with the gamelog
- Fixed /reverselog not working as it should
- Fixed a crash caused by chakrams and other weapons with similar heavy attacks


**** 2021.02.06 Patch Notes
- Added a /bigmap layout, which shifts some interface elements around to accommodate a much larger, centralized mini(?)map. Enabling this layout will also trigger some other interface changes which can be controlled individually:
  - /reverselog which switches the direction and order of game log messages. The most recent event will be at the top.
  - /objectivewindow which is a new window in the upper left for tracking active quests
  - /widescreen and /screenwidth will not work with /bigmap enabled. If you are playing on a lower resolution screen, you may need to zoom out with [Ctrl] + [-] to see the game log below the map.
- Adjusted Plague Doctor: The negative conditions they spread now affect targets for twice the duration of the original effect
- Replaced several chest types with more generous versions
- Certain scenarios now scale in physical size based on distance from Relica. Dungeons, for instance, get much larger the further out you are.
- Adjusted auto-targeting to favor entities that aren't nearby party members
- You can now dig holes in settlements
- Entities with innate elemental properties now trigger elemental effects with unarmed heavy attacks
- Lowered base bag capacity and increased the capacity gains from materials and quality
- The character window is now available after death with [ c ]
- The Curio modification window no longer lists items that already have that curio
- The fishing action is now interrupted by attacks
- Added an option to the /rest confirmation screen to rest until the next morning
- Added and updated some animations
- Removed Rune of Darkvision
- /increasefont and /decreasefont now only affect the game log, and not the entire interface.
- /inspect now reads out the specific capacity of bags
- Fixed an issue with certain groups of NPCs not being partied together as intended
- Fixed an issue which caused the Attack Confirmation dialogue to pop up when attacking corpses
- Fixed a pretty massive oversight with how stats were calculated under certain conditions
- Fixed SO MANY issues and bugs with the titan encounter
- Fixed a few issues with mouse menu actions such as Grab not showing up as options when they should
- Fixed some minor display issues with /map cutting off the top or bottom of the displayed map
- Fixed more instances of TTS cutting off


**** 2021.01.30 Patch Notes
- Made certain domesticated animals easier to befriend and tame
- Fixed an issue with 'highly effective' attack messages showing up in situations where it wasn't true
- Fixed a bug which could cause stackable items in your possession to disappear or behave strangely if you craft more of that item
- Fixed some crashes caused by certain controller buttons during character creation

**** 2021.01.28 Hotfix
- The Appraiser trait now provides a chance at getting a higher quality chest instead of a guarentee.
- Fixed a bug with overly geometric terrain generation
- Fixed a bug which could cause /giveall to give the wrong item
- Fixed a bug which could cause the player to become hostile to themselves when selfcasting certain spells

- Added a few new Runes

- Adjusted Mortician: Increased stat bonus at night and removed night vision bonus

- Players are no longer locked out of building reputation with opposing factions when choosing to help one.

**** 2020.12.11 After 568 Days, Public Alpha 15 is LIVE!
Long time no see, travelers!

It's been 568 days since FARA's last public update, but that isn't to say the project has been dormant. A dedicated, intrepid group of adventurers has been testing a rebuilt version of the game since July, and that test-of-a-test is now ready for everyone to... test. There have been well over 120 patches in that time, and what's listed below is a summary of the highlights. If by chance you want to read every raw, potentially spoilery, nitty gritty detail without much context, you can find the full 1,300+ line changelog here: http://playfara.com/2020changelog.txt. I want to give my most heartfelt thanks to everyone invited to test the changes over the last few months. You could have spent that time and energy on anything, and the fact you chose to help make FARA a better game means the world to me.

If you haven't already, join us on Discord!


***** SUMMARY:
- The biggest goal of this update was to re-write many of FARA's underlying systems and data structures. In doing so, the game should run faster and scale better with future development. There are also a TON of bug fixes, gameplay changes, and usability improvements. If you've tried FARA in the past and spent more time fighting the interface than monsters, I encourage you to give this new build a shot.

***** INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS:

- You can now hold down the arrow keys to continuously move in a direction. Additionally, you can click and drag from the center of the screen to activate a virtual joystick and move around.

- There is now an interact button in the target window which can either be clicked to perform the displayed action, or at least inform you of what action pressing [ Enter ] will perform.

- Right-clicking in the center of the screen now presents the same target options as clicking on the target window. Holding the right mouse button down while scrolling the mouse wheel will cycle through targets.

- Hovering the mouse over objects on the map will display what they are, and clicking an object will target it and bring up a list of options.

- Added more bump-to-interact options. Bumping into foliage will harvest it, bumping into large ore nodes will attempt to mine them, bumping into non-hostile NPCs will /interact with them.

- Added drag and drop! Dragging objects from the Nearby Targets window and dropping them on your inventory or the game log will attempt to /take them. Dragging items in your possession and releasing them on the game log will /drop them. Dragging items in your possession and releasing them on your target will attempt to /give the item. You can also drag items between your holding, wearing, and inventory windows.

- Added tooltips! You can now hover your cursor over most objects and targets to learn about them.

- Added animations! Several (mostly combat-related) actions now have animated effects which will play over the target window or the center of the screen.

- Added a new interface for building structures. Press [ b ] or type /build with Wooden Blocks near by to create buildings one room at a time instead of tile by tile.

- The health and stamina bars are now displayed by default.

- All of the most frequently used pop-up windows (/character, /spells, /recipes, etc) now have tabs along the top, allowing quick access to the other frequently viewed windows. Continuously pressing [ c ] will cycle through all of the windows.

- Clicking on party members now displays options to view their stats, items, and spells.

- Pressing [ - ] now opens a window which shows the entire local map. If you are in a dungeon or somewhere similar, this map will only show areas you have seen. This feature can also be accessed by clicking the header of the minimap or typing /map.

***** GAMEPLAY CHANGES:

- There is now a static settlement named Relica near the start of an adventure. The further you travel from Relica, the more difficult (and rewarding) the game becomes. There are still randomly generated settlements, but they are few and far between.

- Added fast travel, accessed by either clicking a waypoint or typing /travel (waypoint number). If you are tracking a waypoint, you can also click on the compass.

- Most randomness has been removed from combat. There are no longer chances to miss or crit - both will happen consistently when the right conditions are met. Elemental weapons will always trigger their effects with heavy attacks and never on regular attacks. Elemental spells will always trigger their effects with every cast.

- Jumping while targeted by an attack will cause you to dodge the attack. In the case of a spell, you will take half the spell's normal damage and avoid any secondary effects.

- Ranged weapon attacks now has a reload penalty which adds time to your next action

- Stamina now regenerates over time, and is more of a per-encounter resource than a per-rest resource. Heavy attacks and jumping/dodging use considerably more stamina than before.

- The gap between the lowest and highest health classes has been narrowed. Classes now either have slightly below average health, average, or slightly about average health.

- Most of the primary stats have been renamed, and their purposes tweaked:
  - Strength: Increases damage dealt with melee weapons and unarmed strikes, decreases stamina spent pushing large objects
  - Finesse: Increases damage dealt with ranged weapons, increases chance to disarm traps, increases stealth ability, decreases reload time of ranged weapons, decreases stamina use of jumping and stealth
  - Resilience: Reduces physical damage taken, reduces duration of negative effects, increases stamina regeneration rate
  - Insight: Increases damage of spells, increases search ability, decreases stamina cost of spells
  - Charm: Increases the duration of positive effects, increases odds of favorable outcomes
- Wisdom has been removed

- Added equipment slots - Head, Body, Hands, Feet, and Accessory. Typical equipment will fit into one of the slots. The accessory slot retains the old behavior of allowing anything* to be equipped there.

- Added a trait system. Traits add passive bonuses and features to your character. There are 3 types - Master, Major, and Minor. Master traits are determined by your class and cannot be changed. Major and Minor traits can be acquired from different factions as rewards for helping them. You can have 1 Major trait and 2 Minor traits.

- Added several new enemies, encounter types and scenarios

- Dungeons have been reworked to produce more interesting layouts, and new kinds of obstacles have been added

- Randomly generated factions have been removed in favor of 3 static factions - the Radiant Hand, the Jade Circle, and the Wild of the Wild. There is a lot in store for the faction system, but for now, they serve as the primary means of acquiring traits.

- World biome distribution is far more logical and aesthetically pleasing than before.

-  Meals are now stackable, provide rejuvenation, and only use a single ingredient. Cooking multiple items on a fire will produce multiple meals.

- Crafting materials have been rebalanced across the board. A handful have been removed, and several new ones have been added.

- You can no longer craft unknown objects for twice the material cost. Instead, inspecting an item will teach several related recipes.

- The default maximum party size has been reduced from 4 to 2.

***** CLASS CHANGES:

Blacksmith, Brewmaster, Tailor, Spelunker, Constable, Astronomer, and Yogi have been removed. Their abilities and features have been added to other classes.

- Added Mortician! Ability: Undertaking: Morticians have access to the Fervent Embalming spell which raises corpses to fight for a short duration. Additionally, Morticians do not attract hostile targets when resting outdoors, and gain a bonus to all stats and vision at night.

- Added Peasant! Peasants have terrible stats across the board and can't use magic. If you wanted FARA to be more challenging, here's your Expert Mode.

- Spellthief: They now have an active ability to learn the last ability to affect them instead of automatically learning everything

- Adventurer has been reworked: "Adventurers have an increased chance to find rare items. They also have the Heroic Feat ability which provides a temporary boost to all stats once per rest."

- Pit Fighter has been reworked: "Pit Fighters have heightened stamina regeneration when bleeding, dazed, or immobilized. They also have the Payback ability which deals damage to a target in melee range equal to twice the most recent damage received and causes bleeding."

- Duelist has been reworked: "Duelists gain Opportunity after perfectly timed dodges, allowing their next action to be performed without using stamina. They also have the En Garde ability which increases the Duelist's damage against a selected target while amplifying damage the Duelists receives from other sources."

- Executioner has been reworked: "Executioner's killing blows deal splash damage and knock adjacent targets to the ground. They also have the Last Word ability which deals heavy damage to targets who are Dying."

- Juggernaut has been reworked: "Juggernauts are immune to immobilization and force spells, deal twice as much damage to non-sentient objects, knock down hostile targets after jumping, and can smash through most doors."

- Gatekeeper has been reworked: "Gatekeepers will deflect long-range projectiles, and their shields and armor take less damage in combat. They also have the Protect ability which temporarily reduces the amount of damage a target takes by half."

- Soldier has been reworked: "Soldiers gain increased damage resistance as their health decreases."

- Kung Fu Master has been reworked: "Standard attacks trigger Bear Stance, causing thier next heavy attack to inflict Dazing. Heavy attacks trigger Monkey Stance, causing thier next jump to grant Quickness. Jumping triggers Tiger Stance, causing their next standard attack to inflict bleeding."

- Fishmonger has been reworked: "Fishmongers cannot drown, take greatly reduced damage while Intoxicated and are immune to the negative effects, and have a higher chance to catch rare items while fishing."

- Elemancer has been reworked: "Elemancers have a bonus to all elemental attunements. They also have the Attune ability which channels the elemental energy of a target to boost the caster's relative attunement. Successfully casting the ability a second time will combine the elements, providing two boosts at half the potency. Attunements are lost after rest."

- Scholar has been reworked: "Scholars gain Enlightenment after conversing with someone or learning a new recipe, temporarily increasing their insight. Scholars can cast spells from scrolls at higher tiers based on their insight, and can use the same scroll several times."

- Gamber has been reworked: "Gamblers have access to the 'Gamble' ability which inflicts a random negative condition to either the caster or their target. Charm reduces the stamina cost of this ability and increases the likelihood of afflicting the target over the caster. When used on certain chests, Gamble will either upgrade the quality of the chest or completely destroy it."

- Ragamuffin has been reworked: "Ragamuffins have an increased chance to steal successfully, and can find a wider variety of items. In combat, Ragamuffins can attempt to /steal weapons used to attack them."

- Kunoichi has been reworked: "When attacking from stealth, Kunoichi deal bonus damage and remain hidden if the attack kills their target. Additionally, Kunoichi recover from the Revealed effect twice as quickly, and gain Quickness when Revealed."

- Gamestalker has been reworked: "Gamestalkers immobilize targets when attacking from stealth at range."

- Demon Slayer has been reworked: "Demon Slayers take reduced damage from legendary monsters and spells, and silence enemies with their heavy attacks."

- Wrestler has been reworked: "Wrestlers can use the Giant Swing ability, allowing them to throw a target to an area of their choosing, causing them to take damage, land prone, and become Dazed. Additionally, Wrestlers are immune to being dazed, and do not receive any penalties while prone."

- Bodybuilders have been reworked: "Bodybuilders have access to the Flex ability which will blind a hostile target. If completely unarmored, Flex will also provide a temporary Charm bonus and cleanse negative status effects."

- Kensai has been tweaked: In addition to their Samurai Showdown ability, they now instantly counter-attack after performing a perfect dodge.

- Illusionist has been reworked: "Illusionists will immediately enter stealth for a short duration when damaged by a critical hit. Additionally, Illusionists detect illusions and disguises without fail."

- Rift Dancer has been reworked: "A Rift Dancer's heavy attacks and spells summon creatures from other planes."

Saying there is more to the update than what is listed above would be the understatement of a lifetime. While I could have gone into greater detail, let's not forget that FARA is a game about exploration and discovery. Adventure awaits!



**** 2020.12.10 FARA's Getting an Update Tomorrow!
Hello, travelers!

Tomorrow, FARA will get its first update since May 22, 2019! The official changelog will be posted shortly before the update goes live at 9pm EST, and it's a beefy one. It should be noted that old saves can't run in this new version, so if you're playing in the browser and have a run in progress, but sure to end it as gloriously as possible before then.



*** Void 01 Apr'19..
- There were no updates.
- People panicked.
- Brian persevered.

*** Alpha 14 May'19..

**** 2019.05.20 Patch Notes
The first public alpha for FARA was released one year ago today! I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who's taken the time to try FARA out and provide feedback. This game wouldn't be even half of what it is today were it not for the enthusiastic, welcoming, and dedicated community which has built up over the last year. I've wanted to be a game dev since I was a kid, and the FARA community has made that dream more fulfilling than I ever thought possible. You all have been incredible, and I look forward to the continued discourse that has shaped the game into something so many people find enjoyable. Now, let's celebrate the occasion by making the game way harder:

- Key Fragments no longer resurrect the player when killed.
- Added a new innate spell to the player character - Astral Blessing. This ability expends ALL collected Key Fragments to completely restore health, stamina, and mood. Astral Blessing also bestows several positive effects for a moderate duration, removes all hunger and thirst, and damages nearby enemies.
- Started working on some public leaderboard stuff. When a character of notable achievement dies, retires, slays a dungeon boss, or completes the Astral Key, an announcement will be made in the FARA Discord (https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn). You can set a username ingame with /setusername yourname. You can opt out of this feature with /eventsharing.
- Increased the importance of dexterity for reliably hitting targets with ranged weapons
- Removed the strength bonus from ranged weapon damage
- Made some changes to the start of the game
- Removed wooden planks from the game and adjusted crafting recipes for objects which used them
- Individual keybindings can now be reset with '/setkey keytochange default'
- Made an adjustment which should make it a little easier to build shelters when you have allies following you
- Typing /define without specifying any text wil now show all glossary entries.
- Non-sentient entities can no longer be knocked prone.
- Fixed several broken commands issued via mouse menu
- Fixed an issue which prevented the [ z ] key from being re-bound
- Fixed an issue which allowed certain monster abilities to work on slain entities
- Fixed a bug that allowed traps be salvaged with /salvageall.
- Fixed (more) issues with the Pounce ability
- Fixed an edge case with Elder riddles which allowed duplicates of certain answers
- Fixed a crash caused by entering castles

A fresh game is required in order to continue regular play.


**** 2019.05.17 Patch Notes

  - Increased the durability cost of triggered spellgrafted items

**** 2019.05.11 Patch Notes
- Added a new class, the Bloodweaver! Unique Ability: Hemophiliancy - Bloodweavers have access to the Blood Pact spell which places a Sigil of Blood on a target. This sigil slowly grows in potency over time, dealing increased damage while increasing the power of the target. Casting Blood Pact on a target affected by Sigil of Blood will transfer the sigil to the caster while retaining its potency level. Casting Blood Pact on target while affected by Sigil of Blood will transfer the existing sigil to the target. Only one Sigil of Blood may be active at a time.
- Reworked Beekeeper. Unique Ability: Hiveminded - When Beekeepers interact with beehives, they become swarmed by a mass of bees which they can command using the Send Bees and Call Bees abilities. Beehives of different materials produce different kinds of swarms. Beekeepers have no additional materials cost for building unknown hive types, and are immune to the negative effects of swarms.

  - Reduced health to Below Average
  - The trigger chance for elements on their armor is now based on the quality of the armor

The quality of the saddle as well as several other factors determine the likelihood of successfully taming an animal.

- Entities can no longer trigger elemental effects via self-targeted skills and abilities.

  - The dodge chance provided by dexterity now only applies when moving or jumping. This means that in order to be successful with a dexterous character, you actually need to move around as you fight.

- Pigments and Scribe Chests have been removed from the game, and instead areas can be marked freely with the new /mark (color) command. Areas can be cleaned with /clearmark.

a fresh game is required for everything to work properly,
and the game probably won't start at all if you attempt to load an older save.

drop by and make some friends! https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn

.* Highly debatable.

**** 2019.04.01 Public Alpha 13 is LIVE - Combat: Evolved

***** NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 13:

- This alpha release overhauls FARA's oldest, and quite frankly, most confusing system - combat:
  - Offensive attacks, defensive attacks, evasive attacks, balanced attacks, pushing, kicking, and parries have been removed in favor of just two attacks: Regular attacks ([ a ] or /attack) and Heavy attacks ([ shift + a ] or /attackheavy).
  - Regular attacks behave mostly like Balanced attacks from pre Alpha 13.
  - Heavy attacks tend to be slower, more powerful, use stamina, decrease weapon durability, and trigger special effects based on the weapon used. For instance, performing a heavy attack with a dagger or similar small blade will cause the attacker to leap backward evasively after the strike. Other heavy attacks can deflect projectiles, apply status effects, etc.
  - Entities gain most of the benefits provided by the removed Defensive/Evasive stances as long as they can see the attacker and are not performing any actions (including attacking)

- Entities no longer need a target selected to attack. Attacking without a target will now just attack in the direction you are facing.

- Reduced the damage of most melee weapons
- Combative NPCs will now investigate strange noises they hear from unseen entities

- Clicking the center map tile now opens the main menu instead of searching
- Truncated very long names in certain menus (looking at you, Champions and Scrolls)
- Wrestlers are now immune to Dazing
- Moved positions like standing and crouching to their own submenu in an effort to keep the Gestures & Actions mouse menu from getting too tall
- Entities now have a chance to fail at disarming traps not set by them. Failure will trigger the effect of the trap. Inspecting a trap can tell you how difficult it is to disarm.
- Increased the amount of settlements generated at the beginning so every NPC you meet doesn't ask you to go to the same place
- Salvaging inventory items will now place the salvaged goods in your inventory if there's room
- Fixed a bug that prevented leaving local areas via rivers
- Fixed some erroneous text related to climbing objects
- Fixed an issue that caused hostile NPCs to target the furthest enemy from them, causing them to run back and forth attacking nothing if they had more than one valid target
- Fixed a display issue with container items not always being listed directly under their container on the Nearby list.
- Fixed a display issue that could cause certain map tiles to appear above menus and dialogue windows
- Fixed more instances where browser auto-complete could get in the way of user inputs
- Fixed an issue where pressing the [ 1 ] or [ enter ] keys multiple times to load a save could cause the game to crash, hang, or reload.


**** 2019.03.02 Public Alpha 12 is LIVE - Mouse/Touch Support!

***** NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 12:

- This alpha release introduces a pretty big game-changer regarding accessibility - FARA can now enjoyed with a mouse or touchscreen! As much as I love writing beefy changelogs, the changes are pretty simple:
  - Clicking/tapping objects on the side panels will display a tiny* menu with various contextual actions
  - Clicking anywhere in the central game log or status section will provide access to more general commands and features
  - Clicking on a map tile will now move your character toward that tile. If you're in a local area, you'll zip right to the targeted location in one click. If you're on the world map, you'll move one tile in the direction of the cursor. Clicking the center tile will search the area.

***** QUALITY OF LIFE AND OTHER CHANGES:

- Rebalanced health values across all classes. If your favorite class went from 'Above Average' to 'Average' health, it doesn't necessarily mean the value is lower than before. Additionally, the classifications of health no longer vary between classes. Two classes with 'Above Average' health now have exactly the same amount.
- Pressing the [ enter ] key will now trigger the /interact function with your target if the command prompt is closed.
- Dramatically improved the pathfinding capabilities of NPCs.
- Added richer descriptions and additional mouse menu options for those interested in playing with the UI disabled
- Added /moveto command which pathfinds your way to a target
- /takeall no longer picks up Supply Crates and Barrels
- /salvage and /salvageall will now open all nearby Supply Crates and Barrels
- Tweaked some things to make the game less frustrating for players who (for whatever reason) want to play the game on mobile devices. FARA still isn't exactly mobile-friendly and I still wouldn't recommend playing it on a phone if you can help it, but this patch should make such a thing far more possible, particularly on Android devices running Chrome.
- Fixed a bug that prevented the dexterity score of certain animals and monsters from being properly applied
- Fixed a bug that could cause cooking from the Quick Actions menu to cook the wrong item
- Fixed a crash related to destroying boulders
- Fixed a bug that would cause party members to rob you in your sleep. May re-add.
- Fixed a bug with climbing that allowed entities to remain elevated even if the climbed item was destroyed
- Fixed a bug that caused commoners to suggest visiting the town you're already in
- Fixed a bug that could cause colosseum Champions to leave a life of glory behind in favor of murdering you in your sleep for no reason in particular
- Fixed a bug that allowed abused Combat Dummies to cast aside their shackles and hunt down their oppressors

***** HIGHLIGHTS SINCE PUBLIC ALPHA 0.0.11.0:

- Farming! It's pretty simple for now - drop a seed into a Hole and it'll turn into a Plot. After a day or so, your new plant(s) will shoot out of the ground.
- Revamped settlements with more organized layouts, plots for new developments, and the partial re-introduction of quest-based town expansion
- More descriptive combat logs
- Quests from Bounty Boards no longer disappear when accepted and can be abandoned and tracked again later.
- Dramatically increased the performance of map animations with minimal* downsides
- Butchering a salvaging now teach you about the objects/animals before dismantling them
- Added an /exit command which will return the player to the world map from a local area. It can also be done with /leave.
- Expanded the functionality of /interact
- Added some friendly fire protection. Attacking a healthy party member once will no longer cause them to turn on you. Attacking them a second time within a certain time frame or while they are Injured or Dying will cause them to retaliate.
- Overhauled the movement speed system and made the stat visible in the /character window
- Increased the health of several classes designed to fair well in melee combat

- Fixed a crash related to ponds (nearbyObjects not defined)


**** 2019.02.01 Patch Notes ALPHA 11


This one is a doozy. Where do I even start?


***** NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 11:

- Combat and object interactions have been removed from the overworld.

  Most of the game now takes place at the zoom level once reserved for indoor
  spaces and dungeons. While viewing the overworld map, press [ Enter ], [ e ],
  or type /explore to drop down to the local level.

  - As you travel, you will happen upon encounters which automatically trigger
    the local view. Having most the game take place at the local level offers
    many new and exciting perks:

- Bump to attack!
  Under most circumstances, living entities can no longer share the same map
  tile. Among other things, this means you can now attack hostile targets by
  simply walking into them.

- Ranged weaponry in general is now much more viable.

- Most interactions that required entities to be on the same tile can now
  happen from 1 tile away.

- The open spaces allow for more tactical combat. You can utilize terrain
  features for cover, stand against large objects to avoid being surrounded, or
  climb trees to get a better vantage.

- NPC path-finding has been beefed up so they aren't so easily bested by trees
  and building corners.

- Area of effect spells have been reworked to take advantage of multiple tiles

- The jumping mechanic has been reworked, and is now an indispensable tool
  when dealing with attackers at range.

- Settlements and encampments are now truly explorable areas.

- Buildings as items have been removed, and instead players can craft walls and
  floor tiles. Using these, you can create any building size and shape you want!

- Rivers and ponds are no longer targetable objects, and are instead features
  of the landscape you can walk up to and utilize.

- Several classes have been tweaked to take advantage of the new mechanics and
  space.

- Added several new map effects to basic combat

- Added pigments! Pigments allow you mark an area with a specific color, and can
  be combined to produce every color under the rainbow.

- Added a little color variety to the target dots on the map

- Added party member items to the /compare window

- Reworked the robbery mechanic to be a bit more engaging and straightforward

- ADDED THE ABILITY TO PET ANIMALS

Getting all of the old systems up to speed is an ongoing effort, so expect a few
more related patches next week that address new issues like movement speed.


***** CLASSES CHANGES:

- Adventurer: When exploring a local area, Adventurers can tell if there's
  treasure nearby.

- Dervish: New Ability: Dangerous Dance - Dervishes gain the Whirling condition
  after dancing. While whirling, Dervishes cannot be parried and have a chance
  to cleave all targets in melee range when attacking.

- Monk: New Ability: Path of Fire - When Monks jump, they have a chance to set
  enemies along their path on fire. When burned, Monks are cleansed of most
  negative conditions.

- Reaper: Greatly increased the amount of health gained from killing an enemy

- Spelunker: Instead of glowing in the dark, Spelunkers now have permanent
  Darkvision.


*** Alpha 10 May'18..
**** HIGHLIGHTS SINCE PUBLIC ALPHA 0.0.10.0:

- Added ~50 new items

- Added recipe items! Reading recipes will teach the reader how to create a
  specified item.

- Added a /salvageall command to salvage/butcher everything within reach. The
  command will show in the Quick Actions menu when applicable, and can also be
  done with /salvage all, /butcher all, and /butcherall.

- Dramatically increased the variety of dungeon monsters with the new prefix
  system. These prefixes should give players an idea of what areas a particular
  monster may excel, and where they might be vulnerable.

- Masterwork items may now be infused with up to two elements, granting the
  effects and resistances of both elements.

- Revamped the /define command to show multiple results and actually be helpful

- So many bug fixes I actually stopped keeping track. If it was reported before
  today, it's either been fixed or accepted as a feature.


**** FARA Public release May 2018

This is far and away the biggest update FARA has received since its public
release in May 2018, and I'd love your feedback. If you haven't already, please
consider joining us on Discord! https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn

Finally, I want to give a BIG shout out to everyone in the FARA Discord who
helped test earlier versions of this release over the past two weeks. They
suffered tremendously so that you might suffer slightly less. These expansive
changes might have never seen the light of day were it not for their positive
feedback and encouragement, so thanks for taking the time to provide some top
notch insights. There is still plenty of in-game text that needs updating and
bugs that need squashing, so if you come across something that doesn't seem
quite right, be sure to let me know!


** Disclaimer
This document is hereby released without any claim of ownership on other
people's content and without claims of copyright by compilation or any or other
claims I could make to keep you from contributing to the game.
** Linux

To run this game in linux, this is what you need to know.

- you need sudo access/rights

  once you unpack the distribution, change to the game directory and issue
#+begin_src sh
sudo chmod +x ./FARA
sudo chmod 4755 chrome-sandbox
sudo chown root:root chrome-sandbox
#+end_src

you likely wont be able to run the game from your file-manager since FARA is technically
a shared library, so, from the shell type *./FARA* to get it going from its dir.

if you want a thing to right-click to start the game, issue:

#+begin_src sh
echo ./FARA >./fara
sudo chmod +x ./fara
#+end_src

- save-games go into *~/.config/FARA*

that's chrome's doing and because the save-files are pretty large consider
symlinking that path to a place thats backed-up once a day, not hourly.

- the game plays well under X

 and since the only time it really needs the disk is
  for saving, you can run it from a NAS or server without troubles.

 /uianimation and screen-shaking should be disabled under X

- the actual thing you would appear to need to update between versions,
  as long as the runtime does not change is 'resources/app.asar'.
  its amazing that its just 2.8mb.

For more on electron apps, check out!
- https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=app.asar


** Requirements
Pug's experiments suggest:
- 2+ GHZ,
- 4ish GB ram for chrome/electron/fara (at most!?)
- Anything but not a dual-core cpu!
- FARA needs at least three concurrent threads to be performant and having just
  a dual-core cpu will ~half the game's speed
- Optimal? anything quad-core with DDR-4 ram; DDR-3 will do.
- Disk seems not important.
** Visualizing Waypoints
- Watercolor paper and a pair of compasses :-)
- or disembody and hack up something ;-)
  https://www.startpage.com/sp/search?query=visualize+relative+location+edge+distance
- graphvis doesn't do edge-lengths, at least i dont think so,
- but maybe some simple scripts with an adjustable data section in an svg would
  empower players smart and geeky enough to keep notes about their world
