# Pug's FARA Notes
## Everything I'll need in my next game

For the adventure-game of awesomeness from https://brianiscreative.itch.io/fara

'Rolling unannounced updates' to these notes appear on the [web-page hosted at this repo](https://fara-pug.github.io/fara-pug/).

The HTML version has a style-sheet optimized for readability. I keep meaning to use that for proof-reading.

A second, always in sync version uses a [more technical style](https://github.com/fara-pug/fara-pug/blob/main/index.md) that makes the notes and tables look crisper.

The writing and production of these docs takes place in Emacs/org-mode since that's what I know and spend a lot of time with IRL. As every Emacs user wants to spread the gospel, I invite you to take a look at [some org-mode videos](https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=emacs+org+mode+outline+youtube). Long story short, if/when you try org-mode you'll want to use the [source-document](https://github.com/fara-pug/fara-pug).

Since my schedule does not allow me to play all that often, find out about updates to the notes by subscribing to <https://github.com/fara-pug.atom> via an rss-feed reader.

I like the [Feedbro Reader](https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=Feedbro+Reader) since it works well in almost any browser. Set the update interval to weekly to catch up with changes and improvements to these notes. Set "maximum items to keep" to 1.

Make sure you also subscribe to Brianiscreative's [FARA RSS feed](https://brianiscreative.itch.io/fara/devlog.rss). If you haven't, do it now!

I will see any DM's you send me on Discord, when I'm not busy elsewhere since Discord doesn't get to email me. To get my attention though, make an account on Github and post a comment to trigger an email that way. Its no bother at all! Email will reach me most weeks.
