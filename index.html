<p>
Starting with <a href="#org7fee277">0.0.16.5d</a> FARA become faster than ever!
</p>

<p>
Gone are stuck popup, slow keys, its very responsive even on slow machines
now. New quests, right-clicking on the map moves you, the sizes of many
consumables have been perfected, inventory and storages can be sorted, the big
map became much nicer and overall - there's a ton of nice little tweaks!
So cool! Thanks Brian!

<p>
I love the depth and variety in this game. The encounters can be short and
sweet, or long and trecherous. The world has beauty and there is heaps of
creativity in the maps and their many variations.  The exploration and combat
systems are challenging and yet you almost never feel as if the game is out to
get you.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
FARA is a Nethack for the new millenium.
Its brilliant and innovative like a rogue done right!
  &#x2013; Pug.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
FARA is an open world sandbox that never rushes you to advance, while seeming to
adapt to your powers to keep even low difficulty zones full of surprises. You
will enjoy the turn-based combat, the ability to explore dangerous places with
capable and fearless mercenaries to help. There are 54 classes with unique
traits that simply make sense. The RPG steretypes and classes you know will 
begin to look primitive as you learn to play different classes and explore
FARA's many mysteries.
</p>

<p>
If you don't know what I'm talking about, visit <a href="https://brianiscreative.itch.io/fara">FARA's Homepage</a> and take a look

<h3 id="orgdbb00b5"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Notes about these Notes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
This page serves as a repository for my notes about the game. 
</p>

<p>
During my first play-session some years ago I hit a wall and swore to myself
that I would beat this thing one day. And I finally have.
</p>

<p>
It was not a big, triumphant, clever win. Definitely not! I played, what looked
to me like the most survivable class, the <a href="#orgd8d197e">Gatekeeper</a> as defensively as I could
and for 150 days stuck my head into dangerous places, learning and exploring as
I went - and now that my understanding has grown, my notes and my approach to
them is evolving too.
</p>

<p>
Winning, for me meant 'Completing the Astral Key'. It also marks the beginning
of what puts my Character into the 'Age of Steel', sees me Mining and Fishing
more, and at last! has me manage inventory and items the way the Elders intended.
</p>

<p>
Pug's Notes don't reflect all I've learned by reaching my milestone yet,
but they are certainly not harmful if you're just starting out.
</p>

<p>
At 7300+ Lines the html page is 540,000 bytes long, and that's just about as
much as I want to put into a single searchable page. The release notes will
likely move into their own file once I've gone through them some more to make
sure that I've not overlooked to many things you would only find by searching
this one place here, where they are all collected. This will make room to allow
for more text/stories/guides/Q&amp;A and perhaps the occasional image. TBD.

<p>
As these notes change 'rolling unannounced updates' appear on the <a href="https://fara-pug.github.io/fara-pug/">web-page
hosted at github</a>. The HTML version I link to has a style-sheet optimized for
readability. I keep meaning to use that for proof-reading.

<p>
The source version renderes in a <a href="https://github.com/fara-pug/fara-pug/blob/main/index.org">crisper more technical style</a> that makes
the notes and tables look exquisite &#x2013; but lacks indicies.

The writing and production of these docs takes place in Emacs/org-mode since
that's what I know and spend a lot of time with IRL. As every emacs user wants
to spread the gospel, I invite you to take a look at <a href="https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=emacs+org+mode+outline+youtube">some org-mode videos</a>.
Long story short, if/when you try org-mode you'll want to use the <a href="https://github.com/fara-pug/fara-pug">source-document</a>.

Since my schedule does not allow me to play all that often, find out about
updates to the notes by subscribing to <a href="https://github.com/fara-pug.atom">https://github.com/fara-pug.atom</a> via an
rss-feed reader. I like the <a href="https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=Feedbro+Reader">Feedbro Reader</a> since it works well in almost any
browser. Set the update interval to weekly to catch up with changes and 
improvements to these notes. Set "maximum items to keep" to 1.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Instead of simply dying and staring at your screen dumbfoundedly, the force
which brought you into the game supports you again by giving you get a chance to
come back to solve the real mysteries of FARA.
</p>

<p>
That's to say, you somehow come back to life, just a little shaken and just a
little bit worse. When you come back, you might suffer or notice <b>one</b> of these
effects randomly applied to you. A lot of people died researching this; A
moment of silence please!
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Increased Damage Taken</li>
<li>Increased Encounter Rate</li>
<li>Increased Stamina Use</li>
<li>Reduced Charm</li>
<li>Reduced Damage Dealt</li>
<li>Reduced Finesse</li>
<li>Reduced Food Effects</li>
<li>Reduced Insight</li>
<li>Reduced Inventory Capacity (-5 per blight)</li>
<li>Reduced Resilience</li>
<li>Reduced Strength</li>
<li>Stronger Enemies</li>
</ul>


<p>
Each of these Blights decreases your chances of resurrecting again. Exactly what
that means is unclear.. except that it will prevent you from cultivating your follies.
</p>

<p>
From Discord:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Taking the first blight is a guaranteed success I think? I never had it fail,
and it does make sense.</li>
<li>I got 4 Blights once. I never got more than 4, though this doesn't necessarily
mean its impossible. It would require a lot more testing to be sure.</li>

will ever save you from his unending wrath.</li>
<li>I think you might have an increased chance of levelling up a blight instead of

<p>
You can break down these classes into three primary approaches at the start of
the game.  FARA is very classic in this way and you can think about the
approaches as being Melee/Strength, Rogue/Finesse and Magic/Insight based at the
start of the game.
</p>

<p>
But you needn't get locked in, feel limited by this. All your stats will improve
and everyone has the potential to reach GODLIKE in all the stats &#x2013; by which
point you'll be able be effective in at least two, if not all three of these
approaches.

Bloodweavers have access to the Blood Pact spell which places a Sigil of Blood

damage while increasing the power of the target. Casting Blood Pact on a target
affected by Sigil of Blood will transfer the sigil to the caster while retaining
its potency level. Casting Blood Pact on target while affected by Sigil of Blood
will transfer the existing sigil to the target. Only one Sigil of Blood may be
active at a time.

</p>

<p>
Botanist is one of the interesting classes you can use in Fara, their unique
ability "Familiar Phytology" has a huge potential if you know how to use it
efficiently. First of all let's see what the ability is about.
</p>

<p>
Familiar Phytology - Botanists have access to the Enrich Plant skill, which
allows them to turn any plant into allied Plant baby. Feeding Plant Babies by
hand will cause them to grow more powerful, and the chosen food will determine
what abilities/skills they have. Casting Enrich Plant while already having a
plant familiar will kill the older familiar.
</p>

<p>
Basically after using the "Enrich Plant" skill of the botanist on trees or
bushes will turn them into an ally plant baby. An allied plant has a total of 4
stages.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Baby, Kid, Beast, Behemoth</li>
</ul>

<p>
As you may have read earlier plant allies can be evolved by being hand fed
anything that is edible. You will need a total of 55 food to max out the
evolution process of your plant, but always remember to think about on what the
55th food will be since that will determine what type of behemoth you will get!
Other than being being able to get them from your first day in your run, you can
make new ones that will be stronger the farther you are from Relica! So far I
have only tapped into Veteran behemoths but I think there are far more stronger
variants the farther we go, for now I will show the stats of an amateur ones
below.
</p>

<p>
Number of how many you have to feed before evolving along with stats and skills

<p>
This may help you in the early run if you can get them into a behemoth fast
since you may also get a mercenary as another companion with your first battle
chest reward when you get to Relica. The stats will go up as you make plant
allies when you are farther Relica, and also another good thing is it will not
cost you anything other than some few seeds and berries here and there.
</p>

<p>
and their type (which determines attunement,
spells, and stats) is based on what you feed them.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-2-2-1-11-1">
<p>
This class excels in melee combat due to Its Good Resilience and Above Average
Strength/Health, which allows this class to take lots of damage while dealing
good damage up close. 'Know Thy Foe' also Silences enemies, preventing them from
spellcasting. Classes that rely on spells are at a huge disadvantage against
this class.
</p>

<p>
Some good ways to effectively use Demon Slayer are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Always keep spells that give you Rage, Fortification, and/or Rejuvenation, on
you. These spells will come in handy if you cast them before you engage an
enemy.</li>
<li>Hearty and Robust Meals/Mixtures/Dishes are good for temporary buffs before
you fight something or explore dungeons.</li>
<li>Try to keep most, if not all, battles up close. You can choose to raise
Finesse of you like, but keep battles up close at the beginning of your game.</li>

<li>Get a crystal/iron/bronze fishing rod</li>

<li>Preferably iron, since it's easiest</li>
<li>(find a fortress and salvage the doors)</li>
<li>(You need to craft a wooden fishing rod to unlock other recipes)</li>
<li>Now, go back to spawn with the lake</li>
<li>And fish until the rod's ruined</li>
<li>With the Fishmonger trait, you should have enough runes to salvage into runic shards and make a repair kit with your dowels + shards</li>
<li>Use the repair kit to repair the rod</li>
<li>Repeat that process</li>
<li>passing down anchient knowlage</li>
<li>You should slowly get enough extra runic shards to craft refined tools (25 shards)</li>
<li>Use them on the fishing rod</li>
<li>Continue fishing until the rod is [ruined] and repairing the rod by salvaging the runes</li>
<li>Make it artisan (50 shards)</li>
<li>Then start making your other equipment refined</li>
<li>And then artisan</li>
<li>secret knowlage here wow</li>
<li>You should also get a whole bunch of runes that are useful for you</li>
<li>Get a rune of curses and a rune of intoxication</li>
<li>And set them aside when you get them</li>
<li>Once you've got both, drop them in the same place and use /makespell or /ms</li>
<li>You will now have an arcane curse of intoxication</li>
<li>Fishmonger takes significantly reduced damage while intoxicated, so you can /selfcast 3 to give yourself an arcane curse of intoxication</li>
<li>The reason the element chosen is arcane is because very few entities use the arcane element</li>
<li>And curse spells increase damage taken from an element</li>
<li>The intoxication rune has to be on an attacking spell, since it's a negative effect</li>
<li>Basically You curse yourself with intoxication + increased arcane damage taken</li>
<li>i knew thats an exploit. i just thought i could use some vodka or smth :slight<sub>smile</sub>:</li>
<li>But nothing really uses the arcane element so you only really get intoxication</li>
<li>Yes, you can use vodka and all other alcohol</li>
<li>so in summery fish fish fish curse fish fish fish and get POWA</li>
<li>Fishmonger has 2 spell slots, so you can make a second spell too</li>

<p>
Gatekeeper's are very good at protecting allies, making them very good at escort quests. Their Protect ability allows them to half all incoming damage dealt to an ally, at the cost of around 1/3 of your stamina. They automatically deflect projectiles aimed toward them, and their armor takes less durability damage from combat and wear-and-tear alike.
</p>

<p>
Some good ways to effectively use Gatekeeper are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Try and always keep a Silencing spell ready. Silencing enemies prevents them from spellcasting anything that hinders your ability to use Protect or any other spells.</li>
<li>Gatekeepers have Average Strength and Finesse at the start, so its up to you whether you want to use ranged or melee weapons.</li>
<li>Its also a good idea to keep meals/mixtures/dishes with either Strength or Finesse buffs on hand for temporary buffs.</li>
<li>Shields are very useful to Gatekeepers. With full armor and a shield that has Average or higher damage reduction, there is a chance that the Gatekeeper will be able to take about 2-3 hits without dealing direct damage to your Health.</li>

a wide variety of uses, including the ability to practically teleport to an area
in an instant. Depending on how you want to play Kensai, the class is very
expendable.
</p>

<p>
Some good ways to play Kensai are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>'Samurai Showdown' doesn't have to be used against a target. Since the ability
allows you practically teleport, you can use this to your advantage by
teleporting away from an enemy or conflict that you have a low chance of
winning. Due to the amount of stamina it uses, it is really more of a last
resort.</li>
<li>If you have a ranged weapon (either a sling or bow), you can try this.</li>
<li>Shoot your target at range and keep an even distance. If you feel the target
is getting too close, use 'Samurai Showdown' to teleport behind the target,
then keep shooting at range. This will help limit the damage you take
significantly if you play your cards right</li>
<li>The Fury you get after dashing through an enemy boosts your critical damage,
so it's a good idea to have either a light or an illumination spell to
guarantee a critical hit.</li>

Honestly might try things other than Pugilist when I start playing again. With
Pugilist's main advantage gone (no longer does better than other classes simply
by having bonuses for using the highest attack speed weapons, since attack speed
is gone,) I might try a Nurturing Bees Beekeeper run, maybe a Fishmonger or go
back to Viking or something.
</p>

<p>
Basically just the tanky classes still, but blah. Don't have to think for early
game on tankibois. rip attack speed
</p>

<p>
Pugilist's interrupting heavies are still a huge boon, but I won't be 100% that
it's better than other class bonuses until I try other classes.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-2-2-1-42-1">
<p>
Reaper is a very complex class to play. With low health and strength, its hard
to get kills without learning spells. Some of the most important runes you will
need are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rejuvenation, Fortification, Blinding, Silencing</li>
</ul>

<p>
Another drawback is its ability 'Deathsense', which buffs strength and insight
when a nearby entity is close to dying. With low strength to start out with,
getting close and trying to melee is very hard, and can kill you nearly every
time without the proper equipment. Having at least one healing spell is crucial
to playing this class, as you will find out your health gets drained in a matter
of a couple rounds.

<li>The order of the notes in the song does matter, unless it's the Cleansing song.</li>

<li>*There's seven different ways of performing the Song of Cleansing:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2S and 2L (in any order) and L - S - S - S</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
The attacks don't have to be consecutive, and only the last one has to hit a target for the song to start.
</p>

<p>
For example: you can hit the air three times, travel to another tile,
wait for a full day and even rest and you will complete the song on
your next valid attack (as of 0.0.15.18b)

I read that each new shard contibutes more points to your score than the previous one.
</p>

<p>
Thus if you aim to level up your stats by putting shards into them you should do
it with the 9th shard so that you collect the most unlock points for doing that.

Go to relica and spend an IRL day farming nothing but 'find monster' quests and

<p>
If you're strong enough to move to another settlement, can you turn your naked
self into a being with godlike stats while unlocking all the classes playing the
meta-game of animal researcher?
</p>

<p>
there are 5 primary stats. lets say they average '10 of 20'. you'd need 50 9th
shards to become a god. that's 500 new animal species discovered, and maybe 500
days spent in game.
</p>

<p>
hmm, lol, i wonder how long brute-forcing 10 find-animal quests would take and
if i could resist the urge to just complete the key to be done with the game.

maybe i should complete the key first and see what revelations that brings.

<p>
Your charm doesn't increase your ability to lead a party and it does
not affect your party's maximum size. (max party size may be class dependent)
</p>

<p>
Charm does make it easier to form good relationships with NPCs, meaning that
with more charm <b>/joke</b>, <b>/gossip</b>, etc. will be better received and they
will think you more of a friend for doing quests for them.
</p>

<p>
Unsure how that matters. Will they remember your birthday? Give more loot?
</p>

<p>
More important.. If charm is luck and insight searching, then why isn't everyone
talking about making shovels and fishing-rods from crystal or even obsidian?
I think some testing is in order.. Can it be that people don't like setting up
house on the beach? Whats going on there..

But you know, there's sugar in <a href="#org7c0d5c3">fruit</a>, right?
</p>

<p>
So why don't you wear yourself out, then try what fruits or other food you might
like to take along your raiding missions. Find a way to determine just how long
it might take to eat or drink and just which of these options of replenishing
your stamina are open to you in combat!
</p>

<p>
(I may be overdoing it with the effects of fruits, the stamina restauration 
might equally well apply to all foods.. go try it out!)

<p>
There is an abundance of different materials and most of them seem to be
associated with some kind of stat altering capabilities, that you can gain by
wearing or holding the item. In addition to the material you use when crafting,
the item you are crafting itself may have some base properties making up the
total attribute impact.
</p>

<p>
Weaponry, jewellery, and armour is made from wood, bone, scale, glass, and
minerals, while clothing items are made from cloths and furs - with a few
overlaps such as boots.
</p>

<p>
Note that at this time the precise number of stat pluses given by each material
is unknown, as it is not equivalent to the number of arrows a piece of equipment
has.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(stat)&gt; gives +1</li>
<li>(stat)&gt;&gt; gives +2 or +3</li>
<li>(stat)&gt;&gt;&gt; gives +4, +5, or +6</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each additional nth arrow gives an additional n possible boosts (4 arrows giving
between +7 and +10, etc.)

With the Forgemaster trait: Upgrade your (Refined) items with &lt;Artisan&gt; Tools 
to upgrade them to Masterwork. The catch? you can make (Refined) items with
that trait, they become of &lt;Artisan&gt; quality instead. Swapping <a href="#orge319711">Faction</a> traits
is an option, as is buying manuals in advance!

Mishaal's research on the stat bonuses of armor is awesome!
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We still need that for Weapons!</li>
</ul>

<p>
All listed bonuses are 1.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each level of refinement adds an additional bonus point to the listed stat!</li>
<li>Ignore anything without a bonus</li>
<li>Upgrade breastplates which give a bonus and a malus twice to get a bonus in two stats!</li>
<li>Jumpsuits truly start with 2 boni</li>
<li>Ignore accessories because you want to have a bag or weapon in that slot.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>or the bonus of quiver/bandolier on combat turns out to be real and valuable to you.</li>
</ul></li>

Gizmos, dodads, mods, infusions.. call them what you want, once you've applied
them to a piece of equipment, you can't get rid of them again. Some of these are
really rare and I can't quite judge which those are, so .. Please don't cry if
you misapply!
</p>

<p>
Curios can be found and some of the curios, perhaps all of them are
craftable once you've discovered or obtained their recipes.

Anyone can use any weapon. Results vary by stats alone. Swapping weapons during
combat takes a while and is easily interrupted, so experiment. Shields are
Weapons too. Offhand stats contribute to your character's total. Change out your
runes to suit the fight. See what interrupts you, and what you can interrupt.

In the beginning simply find an empty house, make a waypoint to take you there
with "<b>/slw stuff</b>", and start making piles for the different types of items.
</p>

<p>
Do it so that the list of items in that pile does not scroll of your screen.
When you enter, stop at the first pile and use "<b>/ds</b>" to add alike items from
your inventory at that spot. Then walk to the next pile and use "<b>z</b>" to repeat.
</p>

<p>
When you want to get organized, make "<b>g</b>" act as "<b>/setkey g giveall</b>" would,
put yourself onto a storage, "<b>h</b>" hold the item you want to put there and press
"<b>g</b>". There are a lot more ways to go about this, including some drag and drop,
so keep experimenting with the ever improving ui.

<p>
Due to the presence of rift-energies in the land, its important that you
bookmark locations your're engaged with. Leaving them unobserved will not be
enough to keep them from drifting away from where you thought they were.
</p>

<p>
The attention bound by personal and quest bookmarks appears to attract these
drifters while the content of the world around you reorganizes itself when you
sleep. None of the citizens in your world, except perhaps elder and nobles would
appear to be aware of this.
</p>

<p>
Practically this means that special location like the ones listed here can
<b>often</b> be found in areas adjecent to or in the immediate vicinity of the sites
you have bookmarked. Settlements with their histories and many minds appear less
volatile.
</p>

<p>
All said, a good observer will often find fascinating places, as if by accident,
when they wake up after resting (well sheltered one hopes) in the woods!
</p>

<p>
tl;dr? Peek into the 8 immediate neighbors of the bookmarks you're given and
possibly walk through the 16 surrounding squares to see what's out there!
</p>

<p>
Indoor locations such as Castles and Fortresses offer free and secure overnight
lodgings (secure in the sense that noone will attack you even after you have
won.. if they had't before anyhow.).

Cleared location where you might have a non hostile but unfriendly enemy mount
appear to attrack scoundrel after a night or two spent there. So don't be
surprised if you find yourself suddenly blinded after having stepped on a trap
while getting shot at if you tolerate these untamable collaborators!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-1-2">
<p>
(pix on the discord)
</p>

<p>
I've been thinking about the best search patterns to use if you want to look
around for landmarks.  You'll want to be moving diagonally as much as possible,
because then you'll be neighboring 5 new tiles with every step.  The most
foolproof search pattern, and the one I'll probably be using the most, is a
series of concentric diamonds spaced 5 tiles apart.  So you'd go 5 steps N, 5
SW, 5 SE, 5 NE, 5 NW to complete the first diamond, then 5N, 10SW, 10SE, 10NE,
10NW for the second diamond, etc.  You'll be missing 3 tiles in each diamond, if
that bothers you then you can take a non-diagonal step when you're 2 steps away
from those three corners before returning to the diagonal.  But that's a little
less efficient and also makes the pattern more complicated, I think it makes
more sense not to worry about them and just stick to the diamond.
</p>

<p>
If you want to get a little more fancy and slightly more efficient, you can also
do a spiral pattern.  In this one you start out going northwest, and whenever
you go northwest you need to add two steps to the diagonal length, so go two
steps northwest.  Then go one step west before going two steps southwest,
because the diagonal length is still two.  Then when you go southeast, add three
to the diagonal length, so it's 5 steps southeast. Then 5 NE, 7 NW (because you
add two going NW), one W (you'll always need to go one west after going
northwest and before going southwest), 7 SW, 10 SE (because you add three going
SE), etc.  This one misses 5 tiles per turn of the spiral, if that really
bothers you there are 4 non-diagonal steps you can add to each turn to reach
them, but I recommend not adding any complexity because this is already a more
complex pattern.  The western, eastern, and southern corners of the spiral are
in the same positions as in the diamond pattern, every 5 steps in a straight
line from the starting point.  But the northern corners start at two steps
northwest of where they would be on the diamond pattern (5N+2NW, 10N+2NW, etc.).

Just a wilderness shack. Usually houses a recalcitrant Outlaw of one sort or the

ways, others are just looking to hole up until the heat passes down. Too bad for
them that they see you as the threat to their lives that you are. I mean, you
would have talked to them first if they hadn't gone all hostile on you, right?

Poor Sobs, usually don't even have furniture where they sleep.

an unusual crew with their own agenda, you overheard their leader talking about

<li>I've been doing this thing in labyrinths were I set a local waypoint in all 4

<p>
I tried this method, with a <b>/setkey</b> for <b>/slw</b> and <b>/clearlocalwaypoint</b>,
leaving local waypoints at junctions i was not sure about, then zooming right
back to them. Works brilliantly this way and allowed me to clear a lab in record
time.

Leveling up my character and gear via the legendaries you can find here won't
absolve me from the need to quest for tools and medals by continuing to assist
the elder and others, but it gave me the ability and motivation to go from

<p>
In the beginning count yourself lucky if you manage to dash to the egde
undetected. If you have some wood on hand keep in mind that you can get out if
you're near the edge and that you can place the occasional extra wall or
building to beef up your position &#x2013; especially if you're playing melee &#x2013; to
break the line of sight against what will inevitably be small groups of often stealthy
casters coming after you here.

<p>
Sometimes though it seems as if the crew guarding the ruins has been tipped of
about your plans to attack them, and they will all be standing by your spawn point.

<p>
In these circumstances being a Gatekeeper allows you to put on your second big
shield, cast protect, a ward of fury for maximum retaliation while you attempt
to get out of that mess. If you're lucky, almost all the spellcaster will kill
themselves trying to hurt as you're making your exit.

I might have missed an item there, but suddenly he asked for a crafted input,
turning <b>bone nunchucks &gt; swordchucks</b>.
</p>

<p>
After he wanted the nunchucks he started asking for wooden blocks. Perhaps we're
coming close to a new materials tier after 12..13 runs.. Verry nice, very
grindy, very medal-expensive!
</p>

<p>
<b>3 wooden blocks &gt; wooden anvil</b>
</p>

<p>
Afterwards he wanted bones again..
</p>

<p>
Anyway, now i can consult the <a href="#orge342c53">Materials Tables</a> and better versions
of his more sensible items. neat!

<li>Keeping these prototypes makes sense to me right now.</li>

<li>Signs.. used to be terribly important in the old version i played. Perhaps

<li><b>Retaliation</b> hits Melee, Magical and Ranged attacker with a portion of the
damage they threw at you, not the damage you took. E.g., in the extreme, they
will kill themselves without you taking any damage. Still, the damage
reflection isn't all that great even at high stats but if you can spare the
spell slot, try an Arcane Ward (no elemental runes,) combined with Fury,
Rejuvenation or any other effector rune.</li>

<li><b>Elementals</b> summons an allied elemental in the targeted location, of the
infused element(s?). This can be quite powerful, as it's possible to prevent
enemies from ever reaching you as more and more elementals join the fight.  As
far as I can tell, normally when you cast an Elemental spell you target a 3x3
square, centered on the elemental. The elemental will only attack targets
affected by the area, and will dissipate after they (moved out? or?) are dead.</li>

If you infuse 2 runes into your weapon the effects alternate. Applied to heavy
attack with weapons that have water infused, you'll be halving your healing
potential &#x2013; also .. you can only apply a single status effect on your opponents
by using your weapon. Hit them twice and the effect changes.

<p>
See <a href="#orgbc6c950">Attack Types</a>, Elemental, Attunement

<p>
Spells, once created can not be changed &#x2013; but Items can! So if you don't like
the flavor of your food, the attunement provided by your gear, or find that the
elemental effects of your weapon don't suit the encounter, dungeon, ruins you've
just escaped, use another rune on the item, and everything will be so much better.
Look at the table of <a href="#org66525d3">Element Combinations</a> for more! The last two runes determine
the name.

<pre class="example">
So would you all save those runes or make something from them?
Not sure what the best option here is.

Hm, I think it depends on what is your highest stat

If you have high insight, and a bunch of spell slots 
it could be better to craft the runes into spells

If you have bad insight then casting spells isn't that good,
 because you burn a lot of your stamina doing so
Selfcast spells are good in that case
Like wards, shields or blessings

Those take less stamina to use, and you can couple them
 with good effector runes (like rejuvenation) to support your run

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>See <a href="#org0ac21a9">Obelisk</a> for Spell-levels and leveling, and <a href="#orge6e9021">Runes</a>, of course.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Basically, you
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>chose an elemental rune to determine what type of damage and what elemental
effect it does,</li>
<li>a “stabilizer” to determine what type of spell it is (long range, AoE, etc)
and</li>
<li>an effector rune to apply additional effects when you cast it (like blinding
enemies, getting buffs on yourself, etc</li>
</ul>

<p>
More:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Spell type + 2 elements + effect  adds random stabilizer</li>
<li>If you don't use any elemental runes, only a stabilizer and effector, you get an arcane spell</li>
<li>You can put 2 spells on weapons and armor.  (scrolls /use</li>
<li>Curse spell + any damaging spell is a really good combo to get</li>
<li>in case you want to know spear and blade are generally considered good spells</li>
</ul>

<p>
Shielding:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Two elements (preferably including water)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>rune of shields + rune of rejuvenation gives what I consider the best spell in the game.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Because shield increases attunement to all elements, but does so more so for
the elements included in its spell. This makes it so you can max an attunement
with a shield of that element + 3(? 2? it's been a while since I played) runes
on Masterwork equipment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
New:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Okay, something I did discover is that you can make randomized spells with
just elemental runes</li>
<li>Think you can add a thing to document that?</li>
<li>for ex:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dark + earth rune 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>example: "moon force - cast a force of earth and darkness to damage the target"</li>

The second kind of is obviously better and rarer and I get the sense that the
someone who makes them was more likely to use his or her rarest runes on them so
that they could learn their complicated spells at will in the future. But as all

<p>
I wound up making a "Water Chain of Rejuvenation" and upgraded it using Obelisk
Shards until it became "Flawless". Its not that great with my stats yet but it
doubles as an offensive spell which keeps enemies where they are while i heal a
little every turn for a few turns. It might be awesomer for a ranged class to
use chain spells, but its good enough to keep melee guys from ganging up on me
too badly.
</p>

<p>
I know you experts out there are saying to yourselves.. what an idiot, doesn't
he know.. and I want to stop you right there! I know its not perfect, but its
fine to have to drop an item from your pack if there's not anything else in
range for you to cast the chain on.
</p>

<p>
Anyway.. I had no shield runes when I made the spell 50 days ago. And I still
don't have one, nor did I get another rejuvenation rune since. So if you like
hoarding to figure things out, try not to be stupid about it, these things are
meant to be used .. and you can always spend a week fishing and digging at a
beach. I will ;)

I did some testing about the light element, apparently at no attunement the
illumination debuff lasts for about a single attack
</p>

<p>
At max level it's about 10 moments
</p>

<p>
The critical damage doesn't seem to scale with attunement, just its duration
</p>

<p>
Right after the illumination fades, the target is !revealed for a single turn
</p>

<p>
Still not sure if +critical damage stacks with other sources

Ok, this may not be conclusive, but an obsidian mace with a |hardened tack|
takes about 4 hits to kill a combat dummy. If you have the Fury condition it
takes only 3 hits

Something very good to have if you have 2 or more spell slot 
is a curse spell + another damaging spell.
Probably better if you have 3 spell slots, 
so you have some utility in your last one

yeah fire spear adn curse is brutal
lol, Spear of brutality:

and have like a ward of healing for a 3rd spell
shields is also good as an option, because it boosts your attunement:)

I saw one of my mercs had casted a shield
And I looked at the stats on my reanimated corpse the shield was casted on
And it had attunement in the shield's element

Earth + Fire means slow + poison + burning (maybe?) and extra damage

There are <b>four kinds of attack</b> in FARA. These come as <b>two classes</b> and are
listed here.

<p>
To be clarified and added: all the ways in which these can be applied.
</p>

<p>
There are <b>eight types of damage</b> in FARA. The six <a href="#org06edbd7">Elemental Damage Types</a>
have their own section since they are variations on these two themes.
</p>

<p>
All damage taken can be lowered through the "Damage Reduction" provided through 
a shield and the Gatekeeper's innate 'Protect' ability.
</p>

<p>
Further, elemental damage is reduced by Insight and how well attuned your
magical shield, class- buffs (need info!) and (innate?) acquired Traits such as
the .. of the .. faction make you.
</p>

<p>
Its worth noting that being sleepy and in a bad mood has serious consequences. You 
loose (~?) 6 stat points in all your attributes from such an combo when you go out
and party in such a condition.

If you have more than one elemental rune on your weapon, then they will
alternate with each hard attack you make.
</p>

<p>
FARA canon suggests usinng a single water-rune on your melee weapon and nothing
else &#x2013; since the extra water-attunement will make your rejuvenating healing
spell work better for you &#x2013; and of course weaken a foe's healing potential as
well.

<p>
As you traverse the world of FARA you might come upon caravans along your way. A
caravan consist of 5 travellers and talking to any of them you'll find out that
they have recently been attacked. They suspect one of their own, and this gives
you the chance to play detective.

Each person will list how long they've been with the group, their personal
reason for travelling, as well as a good and bad thing to do at their
destination. These are the clues to identify the odd one out.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-9-3-9-1">
<p>
Typically the activities mentioned fall into the following categories [study],
[trade], [relaxing], [family], and [entertainment]. You will need to talk to all
the travellers and figure out which one they report as the absolute worst to do
at the destination. If two activities are tied, one of them is unlikely to be
used as an alibi by anyone. Confronting and accusing the traveller who says
they're going there for this purpose will unlock a fight. The culprit will turn
hostile and try to kill you. Two ambushers will show up and assault the culprit
first, and you second. After winning the fight you can peacefully collect the
rewards.
</p>

<p>
At the type of writing, it is unclear if telling on the culprit will just fail
the event.
</p>

<p>
Once the event is over all travellers that have not been accused (you could
accuse the wrong one and fail the event) will offer a quest, similar to

It is technically possible to get traits from multiple factions, but it requires
some grinding as each medal given to a faction will decrease your reputation
with the other two. You can also try to do some Reputation juggling by getting
the Diplomat trait and/or being the Politician class to obtain maximum rep with
more than one faction at a time.

The first interaction I had with him was to buy something unknown of course. And
what I got wasn't a random thing, but a rune I had never seen before! Trying again
of course I got a very highly rated rune, the rune of spears. But I already had one
of thos in inventory. 
</p>

<p>
So I don't know. Did his psychic let him give me one kind of rune that I had never had
before then picking something destructive randomly? I'll have to solicit and wait for
feedback to get clear on that, or try it again in the next game. Respect!

to get some more, came back, he was gone .. but had left me a BigChest.  Please
try that if you see one and confirm!

<p>
(This seeming discover appears to have surfaced a bug and atm, an upcoming update
will reset the game of figuring out what traders do. Perhaps they'll soon trade?
Stay tuned!)

You can figure these out by your self, don't sweat them. If there's trouble you
had to run from, kids or monsters or items and belongings you can't find, drop
the damn quest without penalty and get a new batch from the elder, the always
needy people of the realm and/or those workers you brought into your settlement.
</p>

<p>
Here are some really dumb observations about quests:

<p>
There are more types tied to specific locations. I need to add more info here.

Listen man, I know you want to make a name for yourself, impress the Elder and
all that; Don't deny it, we've all been there. But let me give me you a hint
about this thing you dont want to ask about &#x2026; Those tracks you're looking for,
they have the beast's name in it and 9 out of ten times you find them in one of
the 8 directions just a single step away from the settlement. That other time,
you'll to take two steps to find them.

other day. Now be careful reading the tracks!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-8-3">
<p>
You know that times are desperate when almost overyone, no, make that everyone
you meet that's not out to kill you offers you ancestral heirlooms as rewards
for things you've never seen.
</p>

<p>
Needy as they are, they want foods that noone in their right mind would care to
eat, Weapons and other items you have never heard of. And they send you to
<a href="#orgdb68f97">unknown places</a> too. Always they have needs in places you've never been, make you
deliver the weirdest trinkets or their odd selves to hard to find people
and places. The heirlooms from their illustrious ancestors, those medals,
just like their inane request never seem to run out.
</p>

<p>
Well, ok, some of the folks that you ferry between places are actually
interesting to talk to and would appear new to the game and a bit naive as
they just give you unique and valuable items that you can actually use.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you stumbled upon some underground railroad where people of different
factions are relocating all over the map because they are planning something.
</p>

<p>

(from the notes of earlier pug.)

<p>
Stupid Kids! First you can never find them, then you do find one, and when you
bring them home in the middle of the night they want to play hide and seek and
you have to find them in 15 minutes or so. Totally Bogus! aaaargh.
</p>

<p>
Yet again you need to build a shelter. And you need search. At least without
either I've not found a single kid yet. Then you need to rest until morning so
you don't need to make light to find them again whence back in town and they
start playing their games. For that you need to have <a href="#org226ed0e">local waypoints</a> by which to
move yourself through the settlement without going nuts. Do you have those?
</p>

<p>
And then you learn about how to make Burlap Dolls. Or perhaps they have that
very last exclusive item elite tier BP you had forgotten you wanted. I might
never learn what they are about cause I can't find the buggers!
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I find tracks leading to unknown dens instead of children. Are these
really just another type of innvitation to suicide myself?  Do i really need to
press "s" so that I <b>/search</b> every square inch of the site? Or should I stop
being of attracting attention and just run around the location and <b>/shout come

When you get to a new settlement a cheeky elder there is likely to invite you,
the stranger, to suicide by quest.

<p>
Accept then drop any kill-a-champion and other suspicious sounding quests after
visiting their locations without entering. Turn their game against them by going
there to scout for landmarks of interrest in the general area. Enter a few
random tiles nearby to look for 'who knows what' that spawned there!
</p>

<p>
Wait with the scary quests until you have legendary stats and artisan equipment,
or something close to that. Or wait until you are already thriving at a place
even further from Relica than where you first got the suicide invitations.

As you will see later in this guide there are several tiers of materials in
FARA. And for argument's sake lets call the main material you're using and
finding, equivalent to being in an age.
</p>

<p>
You'll be able to survive many if not most of the random encounters near Relica
with relative ease since the Amateur opponents you meet so close to the hub of
lowest difficulty don't have equipment better than yours.
</p>

<p>
Spending time near Relica allows you to not just learn the game but collect any
number of recipes for later use since your ability to re-craft anything you find
using materials is unmatched. Getting these materials, learning the nuances of
your gear and how to enhance it properly lets you you advance advancing to
somet like a later age.

Enter the elemental resistance which you now learn to give to your gear by
applying runes to it. Letting these get to average and better is quite a 
challenge and a profound mystery at first.

food and drink providing buffs, even a Commander Level Faction Trait to help

(Notes from Garon)
</p>

<p>
ATM, landing in relica in the middle of my house, on top of a crate, surrounded by 8 others,
with excesses stored in the warehouse still works out great.
</p>

<p>
leveling up my gear seemed a good thing in the beginning, but now i'm playing it differently,
and it looks like my next game might be all about finding and farming as many labyrinth as i can
since with a few judiciously placed waypoints they are a safe way of gathering rewards and traits
without having to make the elder and other questgivers into best friends.
</p>

<p>
This would allow me to pick a direction and settle in a settlement that's 100,
perhaps even 200 km away from relica within the first few weeks ingame. 
</p>

<p>
I'm still at ~10k points having played it like a turtle in order to research what the game
is like not. Its amazing that i survived this long, at least to me it is. If I ever hit 75k,
I could see having a good time with the commander since labys would help me level up any
crew in relative peace and quiet. A few legendary pieces of gear on me and an NPC, the
profits from a laby shared with him of course, have now let me conquer a brutal monster
in a den. Moving on and up in the equipment power, hopefully fully entering the steel and
later ages so i can move out and discover what's out there at the 200++ km horizon!

<h3 id="org226ed0e"><span class="section-number-3">10.4</span> Trick out your map!</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-4">
<p>
Use <b>/setlocalwaypoint</b> aka <b>/slw</b> at your spawn, at every house, donation
chest, and every last npc on the map. Greet NPC's and put their names into the
waypoint name. You'll be glad you did!
</p>

<p>
There are several buildings of which you'll want to expand at least the
warehouse within the first few weeks game-time. It offers a way to access quite
a bit of stuff from elsewhere. A local waypoint at the spawn and on the
warehouse donation chest will save you a lot of time.
</p>

<p>
"<b>W</b>" makes zooming around the local map quick and convenient. That is unless
there are doors, pets, npc, or even the well along the path. Its not perfect yet
but "<b>W</b>" is a huge help. Use <b>/slw</b> until it becomes a habit.

But there's one thing you have to know: <b>WARNING</b> NEVER LEAVE ANYTHING ON THE

air as your body materializes &#x2013; and that scatters anything you might have left
there through the immediate area. Try it out.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I'm still learning to play the game and I have yet to win. But this is
my second run at it in 3 years and I find that starting as a horder with a base
in Relica is again teaching me what I don't need or want, and how to deal with
everything else. Here's the scoop on what works for me.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgebaf7d0" class="outline-4">

<p>
Next game..  I'm working on plans to rework the warehouse based on where the
door is in relationship to the spawn. I'll keep the donations box which you 
later turn into upgraded storage free and clear with a /slw waypoint right next to
it so i can use <b>/dropall</b> and/or <b>/ds</b> right there. 
</p>

<p>
In the NW/NE I'm envisioning 9 storage chests each. a /slw in the center to 
navigate, on the left the 3x3 design i've gotten used to, on the right,
storages to hold whatever excesses so i have them close yet out of the way.
</p>

<p>
i'd like to make the main entrance be north of the crucible with lights and
so on. I'm not sure about where exactly to put a resting /slw nor about 
exactly where to put the kitchen:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>5 fireplaces for the stat foods</li>
<li>6 fireplaces for the elemental food</li>
<li>foods and ingredients on the floor</li>
<li>possibly no storages but put behind a door
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>for easy dumping with /ds, splitting/pickups etc</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
tbd. I'm now looking for a settlement some 300km from relica which i can stealth
to in 2 hops without winding up in a lake.
</p>
</div>
</li>


<li><a id="orgd291514"></a>Update!<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-10-5-1-2">
<p>
After thriving for 132 days I'm ready to leave this layout behind.
</p>

<p>
I worked beautifully. I used just two storages and was able to do get in 
and out very quickly. But now that I <b>want</b> storages I'm make the warehouse
into Pug's house and place 8 storages around the crucible. This frees up a
workbench and allow the main problem with this layout &#x2013; the escortees that
I wound up bringing into relica to no longer cramp my style. Mind you, they
go their own way after you're not in town for a while, but its better this
lest I give another precious item to them or the elder by accident.
</p>

<p>
So as last night, this is the concept:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Undecided</td>
<td class="org-left">Beddy</td>
<td class="org-left">Runy</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Woody/Clothy/Metally play together really well because of the number of items
that wind up in these storages.</li>

<li>Foods has the Booze, Honey, Eggs, Meats, Venoms, Feathers, Nests and Beehives.</li>
<li>Tooly all my "{&lt;(Equipment)&gt;}", all Shards, Medals, Lights, Lockpicks &amp;
Elemental Runes.</li>
<li>Runy all the Effect and Stabilizer runes</li>
<li>Beddy, a bed and useless flavor trinkets such as towel, blanket, pillow,
a stuffed fuzzy doll, and all the Balls of wax and yarn a real hero needs.</li>
<li>Undecided holds Gear and ammo for what will be my mercs. I'm still happy
with my grizzly atm.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This leaves huge piles of crystals &amp; leather and the problem of cooked foods.
</p>

<p>
I've not worked it out, but there will be 8 firepits and some kind of sensible
way of dealing with buff/food preparation further south in the warehose.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org3abc159"></a>Initially<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-10-5-1-3">
<p>
I build a 7x7 house around the elder and the spawn point, so i'm close to my
piles, quests and right next to a bed, a brazier and the door for the most
restful healing sleep in every settlement I open.
</p>

<p>
<b>THIS</b> is incredibly useful with local waypoints and I get a lot of mileage out
of it! The base layout takes 23 planks, 4 braziers (8 rocks) and a door (2
wooden blocks)

<p>
"There is nothing in any of my warehouses .. except in Relica's." - pug.
</p>

<p>
First off, I don't really like the slow interaction with the storage bins in the
warehouse. 
</p>

<p>
Instead of holding an item-stack to put it into the the number 1 position and 
typing <b>/giveall</b>, I <b>/give #x</b> if its a single item and drop whatever stacked
item right on top of the bins.
</p>

<p>
I dont use scrolls but I keep them in a bin next to the crucible because I
already know that I will be desperate for them when I'm strong enough to get
myself into the best part of the game I know, dungeons! (Please don't read that
to mean that my avatar is mindless about hoarding. After all, some scrolls were
meant to be /salvaged and he's read enough of this guide to know that!)
</p>

<p>
Sure, as player, I could <b>/salvage</b> everything, but my avatar isn't wired like
that. He keeps fancy but not the fanciest kites, beehives, birds-nests, folded
notes, toyswords and other things like that for flavour. Once in the warehouse,
but these things are out of sight, not out of mind.
</p>

<p>
After opening up the (Refinery) I wound up with oddities like Tin Fiddles and
Organs, Bone Spears and Goggles. I love the recipes, but instead of salvaging
them right I stash away the Smith's output in the warehouse get an insight into
what he's doing, knowing full well that the stash doubles as a rune-shard hoard.
</p>

<p>
Ammo. I got tons of ammo of all kinds. When I get a new ranged weapon I try them out
and keep the nicest ones in a Storage box on which i all dump all spare ammo. I find
that much easier than placing stacks into the box.
</p>

<p>
But listen, before you stash anything you find or loot, beat-up and or salvage
the whatever because especially among the items you find on trees, surprises await!

Check out this feedback: Dungeons! It's anything but "best"; It's an hour spent
fumbling around in a dark maze trying to find a key and a door, dealing with
stealthed enemies, and hidden traps! Dungeons are not the best part of the
game. At all.

After settling into the the new place, find a beach and grind runes in style.
</p>

<p>
Plan to stay at the beach/dig-site for a while. Put up a 5x5 with door and
brazier for the good-morning buff and go rune hunting in safety close to
home.
</p>

<p>
When you can make a second workbench, then when you have runes for rejuvenation
and/or other spells go back to 'questing with the elder' until you have at least
several iron pieces or whatever is best for your needs.
</p>

<p>
Take your workbench when you dig so you dont need to make repair kits. Your
enhanced shovel will stay sharp that way. If you get bored digging, repeat the
racket with a fishing-rod while staying in the same shelter. Perhaps you'll even
put up a fire-pit for some extra 'positive outcome boosting' charisma buffing
snacks! Oh, and have a rope on you, just in case.
</p>

<p>
I've heard that noone will mind if you dig up a graveyard from end to end dolled
up in your finest charisma boosting gear either. But I'll let you try it first!

I found a manual that tought me things about fishing. Then I made a great
chrystal rod, took my workbench to the ocean with me and experienced an entire
day passing without getting in the leastt bit tired, so great was the excitement
from pulling rune after rune out of the water.
</p>

<p>
Every other time since, no more than 2 or 3 runes for again spending an entire
day in the water.
</p>

<p>
Is this me; am i unlucky with the maps i picked? can i only have so much luck
per day ingame? All these are open questions, I'll try fishing again later and
see if my luck improves, after wearing out an entire workbench trying that's all
i can do.
</p>

<p>
For me fishing works best if i start by typing <b>/fish</b>, and then alternate
pressing "<b>f</b>" and "<b>z</b>", repairing the rod by right-clicking the workbench 
in between.

Using the "<b>-</b>" view of the map is also really important to me because some of
the locations look great, and its good to know the lay of the land because 
sometimes I'll pick a different corner to go to first based on what I see
</p>


<p>
Keeping Relica as a base around which I explore at varying distances makes
investing into it viable and worthwhile. Thus I've painted up my map with paths
that let me see every time to do local quests for the NPC's quickly to efficiently
level up their loot drop, added lots of waypoints to get to all the places and people
without having to look where I'm going, and am now thinking seriously about just what
kind of storages to trick out my warehouse with.
</p>

<p>
People in the advanced stages of the game talk about traveling 1200++ km from
Relica, fighting unheard of monsters from unheard of dimensions while still
investing there. So that's good enough for me.
</p>

<p>
I don't know enough about the way the difficulty scales, but as I progress in
the game I'll be keeping an eye out for new locations, hoping I find something
that lets me have settlement hubs that are roughly a full day's travel from one
another as I expand.

<p>
FARA's difficulty is a gem. Yes, really. I don't know the formula, but like you,
I appreciate that the things you encounter in your travels seem to slowly get
harder. These things seem to matter:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the further from Relica you are,</li>
<li>the further away you have been,</li>
<li>the more challenging the enemies you have ended,</li>
<li>the better equipped/longer you have been in game,</li>
<li>the more titles (achievments?) you have.</li>
<li>WHAT ELSE?</li>
</ul>

<p>
But unlike most games, FARA doesn't actually seem to be out to kill you as it
did in (what to me were) 'the nightmare versions' released some years ago.
</p>

<p>
Combat in FARA can be freaky cool, and as long as you prioritize survival over
your macho, you'll manage to escape and appreciate the insurance that having a
piece of <a href="#org7c0d5c3">fruit</a>, or a gulp of <a href="#org90c0837">water</a> with you for that one time where
its quicker to drink and hide thant to dash and walk. There's are always <a href="#orgd82111a">surprises</a>!

<li>Don't be shy about using your pick-axes to make paths through town.

</ul>

<p>
Also zipping around the map with the mouse is really fun now. Please keep these
things in mind if/as you mark up your map to insure that you really find
everything like this. If you see that NPC's have moved about from where you last
had them <b>/slw</b> waypointed, use the next item find quest to update your
waypoints and you'll not just find the balls of wax, but the guy you need to
give that nose-ring too with ease.
</p>

<p>
check how many spaces you can move without stopping when zipping around the map by 
placing a small item somewhere and counting. use one color for that.

<p>
npcs you can see at +- 10 range. use another color to mark all the places to click

<p>
Small things on the ground can be seen up to 5 spaces away in a straight line,
but only 3 spaces diagonally. This is true in town and in wilderness maps.

<p>
Thus if you're looking for flowers or lost items you can move in paralell lines
11 spaces apart, that means there are 10 spaces between your lines.

<p>
Thinking that the game's going to <b>improve quite a lot</b>
more this year these are my own little notes 
about things I'm thinking about suggesting later on.
</p>

<p>
Random suggestions/notes/brainstorms/observations.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You know that brown bear that kept me company in the beginning? I probably
mentioned him somewhere in these notes. One day he blocked a door and instead
of pick-axeing my way out, i grabbed and dragged him back to the kennel, err,
the farm. That was weeks ago and the poor guy is still freaked out, at least i
keep seeing him dash about the map from time to time as i walk through
town. He just adds a lot of flair that way. The cat and cat?  They are
well. just a lot more sedate</li>
<li>One day i managed to travel to Relica from within Relica. I got to the top
level map that way. But wouldnt it be nice if you could know that it would
always take you to the local spawn point? Would save a local waypoint too.</li>
<li>Dragging something on a thing in a container to put it into the container!
What could be better? Dragging something from the ground into a container by
dragging in on a thing thats already in that container! Even better? Yes!
Making that container the actively selected item because you just used it!
Could work with opening and closing too. That would be like magic!</li>
<li>Locking items into my inventory so i could not salvage or drop or give them
to anyone or otherwise misplace them. Being able to drop everything but the
locked item.. being able to drop only all locked items. picking up all 
previously locked items from the tile i'm standing on and equiping them,
dropping a locked item into a pile on purpose and picking up it and any
other locked items i had dropped into that spot. Bingo. Outfits. And not
just for the beach! Anyway, once items are locked they show up in their
own section, not more funny number please.</li>
<li>Renaming my storages, seing their names in the target list. and, uh, # as a
prefix key for pressing #30 /take when i really just want to grab 30 ammo
pieces. Psst. Using prefix keys! (imaging having more than one) to attribute
or modify the action of the next command would be, like, really modern and
keep the interface free of not so accessible things like Ctrl/Alt modifiers
which people often seem to throw into their programs to confuse you.
We all know what enter does, right? How about space as a prefix? And a take
option on that use button. hah. then right cloud become predictable always!</li>
<li>So I have this storage with 51 crystal items made from sand i dug up the other
day while hunting for runes. And I want to level up the recipes I've gotten
since. So I screenshot whats in the box and compare it to my recipes list.
You know what a drag that is? Its like my avatar has no way of remembering
how many of what he's already made. Why are pen and paper for a log-book
so hard to come by!? If I couldnt help him via the screenshots he'd still
have a wooden shovel!</li>
<li>Recipes for items in storages</li>
<li>Quests could show the direction and distance to their location.</li>
<li>/salvage all == /salvageall =&gt; never salvages anything installed. even
/salvage would ask you to confirm if you wanted to accidentally or not
/salvage something on your person or installed. that's in a world where /craft
/build and /install would work as one might imagine they would.</li>
<li>Popups comparing a found shield to my weapon instead of my shield. hmm.</li>
<li>Casting a spell on a party member; menu ought to include my class-specific buff!</li>
<li>When casting a buff that'i have running on a party member, lets put him first!</li>
<li>Perhaps no double saving while "Adventure saved!" is on the screen?</li>
<li>Pickup shields into offhand, at least if i just dropped it from there?</li>
<li>Refining items: candidates exclude the things meant held in inventory for my npcs</li>
<li>Manipulating party/npc items spells/items should not exit; also reenter with 'p'.</li>
<li>Empty Storage can be open/closed also.</li>
<li>Setting a trap inside of a storage chest?</li>
<li>/cast 3 without a target means self-cast!</li>
<li>salvageall with non-craftable ingots on the ground destroys them, why? is that
why part of why sometimes you dont get any runes from salvaging several pieces
of runed equipment at once?</li>
<li>if right-click in inventory always dropped the item, and 'm' always moved to
where the reticule was, the interface would be kinda perfect for now.</li>
<li>asking not-selected npc to drop something via the p-items-menu does not select them.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if they are out of visible range, please dont let me ask them to drop things.</li>
<li>the drop the first item of the type, not the specified item</li>
</ul></li>
<li>drinking from the wishing-well! would, uh, make it a well.</li>

@Q if you check the :pushpin: there should be some resources to look at
</p>

<p>
@Pug Unleash your nerd, Pug
</p>

<p>
Q: I'm mainly interested on how to get started with crafting, &amp; what to do once
you complete the quests in the starting town (assuming they don't come back
naturally? Haven't lived that long yet)
</p>

<p>
D: Hm, what questions do you have about crafting?  There's a lot to do out there
haha it's very open ended The main goal is to complete the astral key, but the
game doesn't end when you do so
</p>

<p>
Q: Getting started I guess. I read on the guide on Reddit that you can make a
set of burlap clothing by hunting animals or something?
</p>

<p>
A: oh yeah, that guide is a little outdated now I have a little section about
crafting on the guide I'm working on right now, but it still needs some work
 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZDaeNMFL8keWJFjHb4RbtJWHLHMpzdWgaabcnTl_5D8/edit">A Tourist’s Guide to FARA</a>
</p>

<p>
Q: Ah, I'm reading that right now
</p>

<p>
A: in short, after finding a new object you will unlock its recipe, and the
recipe for that item in other types of materials
</p>

<p>
Q: What should I set my sights on for the early game, while I still have very
little gear? Turning animal hide to leather?
</p>

<p>
A: hm, depends on the class you are playing I would try to focus on increasing
Resilience Metal gear often boosts resilience Some cloth items do that too, but
they are a little harder to find
</p>

<p>
Q: Ouch, but metal armor don't come easy do they?
</p>

<p>
A: Depends how lucky you are haha You can also /salvage stuff that you don't
need to get some extra resources Shields are also good to have your first runs,
but they make jumping and dodging cost more stamina
</p>

<p>
Ahhh

<h4 id="org37dbe6a"><span class="section-number-4">11.2.1</span> Q:</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can't figure out how to complete the "missing child" quests?  I can never find
the child in the specified location, and usually abandon those quests. Are you
meant to search (search command) the last known location of the child, or is
the child simply not guaranteed to be in the targeted location, and may be in
the surrounding area instead? Or a combination of the two?</li>

<li>Escort quests seem very profitable, with a guaranteed artifact as reward, if a
bit dangerous, as well as requiring you not to hire more than one mercenary,
which is a significant hit to your overall power. It also appears to be a good
idea to escort them directly to the desired location, without detours, as
they're likely to die otherwise , particularly in dangerous quest
locations. You could give them a weapon , of course, but then you'll lose it
when you complete the quest.</li>

<li>Certain pieces of equipment seem to be extremely fragile, especially anything
made out of cloth- masks, kilts, etc. I've looted a full set of rune-infused
cloth clothing in between towns and had them destroyed before I arrived. I've
concluded that the best approach with such equipment is to immediately salvage
them for the runes.</li>

<li>Blights are an interesting and flavorful part of the game, and I appreciate
the wide array available, but it's quite punishing to not only receive a
permanent negative condition but lose all of your equipped items, which are
usually the best equipment you have available, and your party members, who
usually also have the second-best equipment you have available. Invariably, I
take a look at the blight I received, the equipment I have left in my
inventory, and commit suicide anyway- there's a certain point where it's
painful to continue, and I'd rather just start a new game. This also leads to
a strange strategy of unequipping all of your items if you think you're going
to die, although I can't tell if that's intended or not. The only thing I can
say is that, perhaps, the owner of a character with nine key fragments might
look at things differently&#x2026;</li>

<li>How do you tame animals? The only information I've found is that you need to
give food to creatures to tame them- what counts as suitable food? I've found
dishes in supply crates, but the Chef and Alchemist class flavor texts also
seems to suggest that you can cook meals as well- how is this possible?
Finally, I'm assuming that you can only tame certain animals- I've seen NPCs
riding Moose and Horses, and Pug the Mage in their reply to my Spellthief Bug
post mentioned Grizzlies as well. Are tamable animals found in the wild?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Well, I think that's it; I'll add some more comments if I think of them.  All
 replies appreciated!
</p>

<p>
Edit: I see hunger and thirst were removed; I was wondering about that.
</p>

<p>
Edit #2: I upgraded my Crystal Wand to Refined quality, and the attribute
bonuses didn't increase? What's up with that? Also, I see that different items
require more or less material depending on their size which makes
sense. However, for example in this hierarchy: Staves -&gt; Sceptres -&gt; Wands, are
the heavy-attack effects of Staves actually objectively better than of Wands? I
haven't played long enough to know how useful the different effects are
objectively, though it seems like the elemental attunement reduction of Staves
would be more useful than the elemental absorption effect of Wands, if you've
already infused your weapon (for this reason I'm slightly regretting upgrading
my wand, but I'll probably upgrade it to Artisan anyway since I've already used
up a toolset). This, of course, applies to other equipment as well. Thanks!
</p>

<p>
Edit #3: My mercenary, Joniqua, keeps entering "droping" status right now, where
they drop anything they're holding. I can't get them to wield anything. How do I
fix this? I'm considering just firing them, given that they're only an amateur
mercenary&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Edit #4: Apparent bug, my water-infused Crystal Wand doesn't heal me at all when
I heavy attack, even though I get the message.  Haven't been able to test it
with melee weapons.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-2-2">
<p>
Alright..
</p>

<p>
/say follow me! or /shout come here will get the attention of any freaked out
and therefore stealthed child within earshot. You might need to move around and
look into different corners of the map for them them to hear you. not too far
when you shout or use a "!" when you say something.
</p>

<p>
escorting people gets a whole lot easier when you /stealth travel from here to
there. of course you'll likely wind up almost drowning in the middle of a lake
when you're only halfway to your destination, and likely at night and in the
middle of a desert where there's no wood to be found to build an overnight
shelter. So take two wooden logs, one for planks for a shelter, and one for a
door to install there. do /stealth again to unstealth the moment you wind up in
that lake i mentioned or you might really drown and die.
</p>

<p>
the rewards vary a lot in quality and can be rather silly bad if you've not done
other quests with that person before. so keep than in mind and take another
quest or two from them so the rewards get better. sometimes you get someone who
has to do a lot of travel for spoilery reasons and you might get lucky with
something really great that you can use for a while. but hey.. none of their
goodies can take runes which makes them useful only within a few 100 km from
home.
</p>

<p>
Fragile stuff? yes. totally. that will make sense &#x2013; and yes, /salvage and /drop
things into your stash house with /ds when you get home traveling in /stealth
while /wearing your equally fragile at first bags!
</p>

<p>
Avoid Blights and deaths with "the strategy of running away" and hoping that the
next map you drop into to heal won't have some imp nuking the last bit of life
out of you. And simply .. never enter dungeons, dens or coliseums. simply don't.
Always upgrade to the best stuff you can find and consider holding a shield or
two for their damage reduction ..
</p>

<p>
.. and getting at least a grizzly to accompany you. or a lake-monster, or an elk
or something bigger than you!  /pet them until they are happy and /give them a
treat. if they like you well enough you'll have their loyalty for life. that
means you can leave them somewhere and they will rejoin you later when you
remind them of your friendship with another treat!  Pets are FARA's better
people. At least until you find a merc that's not simply a stuff-dropping idiot
without any spells or buff-giving abilities that help instead of hinder you.
</p>

<p>
Once you have a few bags you can swap a grizzlies for a merc to help you carry
things. In combat though, they might cost you more in equipment repair than
you're willing to pay at first! So, /inspect and /salvage everything so you
collect /recipes right from the start, make some big shields and troll the woods
around the farthest away from home place you've ever been - in hopes for a bear
that's not a young bear. mind you, a young grizzly will totally rock for a long
time, but look for the strongest you can find and take them back into the easier
zones around Relica to make it easy on yourself.
</p>

<p>
Once you used a tool you'll have its recipe available. Click on a runic shard
from a salvaged rune for the details. And yes, the upgrade do make the equipment
stronger and more durable. Its hard to see sometimes. But you want
that. Consider also a workbench for all your repairs .. and repair that with a
repair kit. keeps costs down.  &#x2013; don't upgrade too much stuff, look instead to
improve your relation with any npc in the next town you find by doing quests for
them. This will give you better stuff without you needing to upgrade things
you'll only need until you for a transition to iron or steel or whatever the
better cloths are for mages.  idk, i'm playing melee, not a mage.
</p>

<p>
And hey, heavy attacks with your wand will heal you a little bit. normal attacks
dont do that. the more water runes you have in your gear, the more that healing
will be, but you want to find and treasure any rejuvenation rune you find and
then upgrade to the hilt any spell you make with that. That's what you want to
keep some of the shards you're making for!
</p>

<p>
Two more things.. unlock the warehouse!  and read my notes. they have a pretty
good index and a whole bunch of tables full of detailed info for my next run at
the game. They should help you too.. and if something's missing, send me your
notes via DM on the discord or a comment on the github or perhaps even here.

<p>
How do I scroll text?  For example, I can't see most of the classes in the
starting class list because they are off the bottom of the screen but I also
can't, as far as I can tell, scroll the text.  Is this a sizing issue?  Is there
a way to fullscreen or window the game so that it works?  I tried downloading
the standalone but that doesn't work either.  How can I make text scroll so I
can read it?
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, my map has disappeared and I don't know how to bring it back.  And
the lack of information about these kinds of commands in general is frustrating.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
I share you pain! 
</p>

<p>
Turns out you can scroll using [Home] and [End], line by line, not screen by
screen, but at least you can scroll any of the game's three panels with the
keyboard and mouse-wheel.  Anytime you have a full-screen popup, it's considered
the middle panel and you use [Home] and [End]. The keys to the left and right of
these do the same in the other panels.
</p>

<p>
When you're in the game at last, press [?] and scroll down all the way to the
bottom for more useful keys.
</p>

<p>
I too get the problem with the game-log taking over your screen.  For that, type 
</p>

<p>
/setkey ; layout1
/setkey : layout3 
</p>

<p>
into the game once. i mean, press <code>[/]</code> to get the prompt, then type the rest over
two lines. <b>then</b> you can press ';' to get your game-screen. Weird, i know, but
its an alpha and learning to use it as most people do for best effect isn't all
that obvious at times. <b>BUT</b> the quality and stability of the thing are both
improving at a rapid clip .. and you can have some really cool adventures
playing in that world.
</p>

<p>
I first tried the game 3 years ago and have written up all the notes i've found
on the web and stuff. You can read them here. They ought to be in good enough
shape already to help you understand what's going on in this cool game.

I don't really play a Necros (Morticians in FARA) much but let me answer your
ancient question anyway.. supposing you didn't "S" stealth and go back to your
settlement to sleep, you would have pressed "R" and chosen to rest until morning
&#x2013; after closing the door and perhaps building a Bed for the "well-rested" buff.
Other than that, one day seems to equal about 120 steps on the overland map.

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>first you can make piles and use /ds to drop more of the same on those piles</li>
<li>when that starts to get annoying you'll want a keybind for /clearlog (if thats
not already limited to some number a mega huge long log will begin to affect
performat)</li>
<li>then you want like 9 storages and a /slw smack in the middle of them.  now you
want a keybind for /hold 8 and one for /giveall.</li>
<li>then it becomes a matter of /drop 8 /hold 8 and /giveall mixed with some drag
and drop and clicking containers to get in and out in as fast as you
can. .. after a few rounds of this you wont even need to open the containers
anymore to know whats in them</li>
<li>you can't drop items into directions and there are rough edges, dragons even
lurking here but they dont give chase; so once you work out how to do it its
ok. just remember to re-equip and /split out a piece of fruit for the road</li>
<li>the easy laziest thing to do is to pick an empty house, zap there with a local
waypoint, then walk over your pre-layed-out piles using "z" to repeat the
"/ds" command.  .. pretty much everything but your runes, spares, teddy-bears
and cooked meals and dishes can go there. hth</li>

<a href="https://discord.com/channels/448497182392451073/448497182392451075/808868280303091764">from discord</a>
</p>

<p>
Get in the habit of doing these things, at least at the beginning:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>/Climb</b> every tree – this is how you find cloths like cotton, silk, and starcloth</li>
<li><b>/Inspect</b> every item – this is how you learn recipes, so you can craft items</li>
<li><b>/Inspect</b> every animal that has a purple “?” next to its name – this is how you get Key Fragments</li>
<li><b>/Salvage</b> items you don’t need – this is how you learn more crafting recipes, and get materials</li>
</ol>

<p>
Reply: .. And then die after getting a few materials because you didn't include the most
important rule: Don't fight until you have at least copper-tier gear. Preferably
iron, but that can take a few fortresses and grinding for glass versions of what
you want.

-&gt; PASTING NEW THINGS INTO THIS MESS IN ORDER TO MAKE SENSE OF IT LATER
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
The first batch swiped 2021.04.06ish by scrolling backward in time a few months
is mostly distributed into this document already.
</p>

<p>
These I grabbed recently. Who knows how much more great insight and conversation
has been lost in the sands of time because.. documentation isnt spoilers, its
what lets other people have fun and what you'll want when you come back in a few
years. .. anyway ..
</p>

<p>
A few things regarding charged rift particles:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First, you can create one by dropping one of each elemental rune and making a spell. This still is very painful, but it won't destroy your stuff and doesn't require an inert rift shard.</li>
<li>Second, on one recent run I found a commoner with a quest to procure a "rift beacon." Turns out you build this using CRPs.</li>
<li>Apparently, they're able to summon Redeemed Rift Beasts which don't appear to be limited by the party size limit</li>
<li>Probably the stats of the Redeemed Rift beasts scale of distance away from relica</li>
<li>They seem to have a days survived stat that's always equal to yours, no matter when you summoned them.</li>
<li>I wonder where you could find the recipe for the RB</li>
<li>it's kind of busted for castle raiding</li>
<li>No idea. Might try feeding Relica's blacksmith until they hit on the recipe. That's how I got a gold ingot recipe.</li>
<li>Trader chests also sometimes come with recipes</li>
<li>Maybe take 3 CRPs to a Summoning Circle?</li>
</ul>


<p>
Blightwalkers only spawn if you have a blight
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"It's form twitches sporadically, and you sense a strange affinity towards it"</li>
<li>oh I discovered how to find them</li>
<li>They spawn where you last died</li>
<li>Ent, but sergals are cheese — Yesterday at 5:39 PM</li>
<li>Interesting</li>
<li>mantecarl — Yesterday at 5:39 PM</li>
<li>My guess is that it's your previous body, or something?</li>
<li>Ent, but sergals are cheese — Yesterday at 5:39 PM</li>
<li>Life always comes at a cost, doesn't it?</li>
<li>mantecarl — Yesterday at 5:40 PM</li>
<li>also, the blightwalker has my previous weapon equipped</li>
<li>Ent, but sergals are cheese — Yesterday at 5:40 PM</li>
<li>Except Relica, apparently</li>
<li>And the tile next to Relica</li>
</ul>

<p>
I wonder if you can steal from them
Ent, but sergals are cheese — Yesterday at 5:49 PM
The dead have nothing to steal
</p>

<p>
Titles..
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mish]: Candance Darkshout the Scholar, Director of Shields recovered a Key Fragment! They only need 2 more fragments to complete the Astral Key.</li>
<li>Its from factions quests (from castles). I think you get one for completing three. I also got a key fragment with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
&#x2013;
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"You closely inspect your Forsaken Skull. Though void of eyes, you feel it still watches. It is small."</li>
<li>ent/ I literally suggested items that give passive buffs from being dropped on the ground, and one of them was the skull of a dungeon boss</li>
</ul>

mantecarl — Yesterday at 11:33 PM
I discovered that if you shout "help" in a castle, all the NPCs will gather around you
Not sure if that's in any way useful, but it's funny
Degritone — Yesterday at 11:35 PM
Get everyone away from the noble, then give them a knife to the butt
Ent, but sergals are cheese — Yesterday at 11:35 PM
Theoretically that would be one of the most harmless places to stab them
mantecarl — Yesterday at 11:36 PM
the noble also comes if you shout, sadly
One thing you could do is setup a bunch of traps
Or just cast a meteor a bunch of times
6 flawless meteors and then stealth
The key will probably be destroyed in the process, but still
Degritone — Yesterday at 11:37 PM
Are key fragments not indestructible?
I've never punched one to test
</p>

<p>
mantecarl — Yesterday at 11:38 PM
oh right
also spells hit but don't seem to do any damage
Degritone — Yesterday at 11:39 PM
Can a full Stamina bar even support 6 Flawless Meteors?
mantecarl — Yesterday at 11:40 PM
Probably, yeah
Spell cost was decreased at some point
Degritone — Yesterday at 11:40 PM
I haven't played a non-Artificer spellcaster, and don't intend to, so I don't know if max INS can reduce the cost enough to be doable, and don't know Meteor's base cost
mantecarl — Yesterday at 11:42 PM
Just checked and it's possible with above average INS
spell cost was definitely decreased at some point
It used to eat like half of your stamina with good INS
huh, the noble is still alive after all that
The advisor is not though
probably good to have a good INS score to boost spell damage
Degritone — Yesterday at 11:45 PM
Huh. So a perfect Pugilist could cast all of the meteors. It'd be funny to see a dude in nearly fully-metal armor walk up and start casting spell after spell after spell.
</p>

<p>
POV: you are a Will of the Wild advisor
Ent, but sergals are cheese — Yesterday at 11:46 PM
The WoTW advisor with godlike resistance to the meteor's element:
Combatereak — Yesterday at 11:50 PM
Lmao
mantecarl — Yesterday at 11:55 PM
apparently it does work lol
you can cast it 8 times and then stealth, and the guards won't have time to react to it
the only danger would be if you destroyed the key to the door
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;
Find a smoking pipe and some goblingrass, hold them both
/s m o k e
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;
there's other ways of getting keys though haha
Not only by killing the noble you can get their key
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;
once you get enough gear it should be possible
Probably better if you have some AoE spells to clear the guards quickly
</p>

<p>
the other way would be to get insanely lucky and fish 10 key fragments in a row
</p>

<p>
dont arcane obelisk and hollow forges spawn like 13 map blocks away from Relic
</p>

<p>
That's why I asked if the speedrun route would be possible. It was literally just weapon &gt; noble &gt; noble &gt; noble &gt; noble &gt; noble &gt; noble &gt; noble &gt; noble &gt; noble &gt; noble &gt; done
</p>

<p>
oh right It's much slower than before, that's for sure

The discord's spoiler channel denizens often refer to 'creative mode' and yet
more <b>/commands</b> but i haven't had the patience or desire to slug through the
jargon there. One seems to need to tap into the voice channel and speak to
people in order to obtain basic information about much of the game still.

If this bothers you as it does me .. because it keep out new players that will
give brian love and some money .. then <b>use this month of april'21</b> to send me
even just a single fact on the discord channel to add to this text before I'm
likely to fade into the void again!

It repeats only most 'last typed (not shortcut) commands' which gives it the

Unless you are a <a href="#orgaadcad6">Wildheart</a> you can talk to your pets and /say or /shout whatever
it is you want, and they won't listen. That is unless you are a <a href="#org88d51bc">Cat Whisperer</a> 
and have managed to recruit one of these marvels.
</p>

<p>
Normal people however can only talk to other people, and it's only the Mercs

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>/say draw your X</li>
<li>/say take that X</li>

<li>use <b>/shout come here</b> when searching for people.

<p>
There's probably some (much?) more to say and other banter to be had. Many of
the options seem to make the most sense for a <a href="#org3584547">Politician</a> however.

Weird fact: Mercs and other NPC's sometimes say random things to one another!

You want to make a shelter and a install a door before you sleep, because
<a href="#org58ee2be">thievery</a> is a thing and can become a real problem. /me learns to tremble at the
thought of having to cross deserts at night without 2 logs. one for a shelter,
one for a door.
</p>

<p>
Outdoors
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>sleep next to a firepit/campfire/torch on your cloak for buffs
if your party is full and you're not worried.</li>
<li>climb and sleep atop a tree if you're just a little worried.</li>
<li>the closer to the edge you sleep, the more worried you want to be.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Doors
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>sleeping next to a wall and a closed door is enough to get you the buff,
even though your house might have several other open doors.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Post-win
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you've been farming shards, beware the shades. They come in search of
the fragments and, if, say, you sleep atop a tree near the edge of a map,
might seriously hurt you. Don't go to sleep again in that same spot after
the fight, or you risk getting attacked by another one right there. You 
might like to farm them this way.. just don't do it when you're trying
to catch on up sleep after traveling for days.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-13-1-1">
<p>
My adventurer Lalli was attacked by some strange lizard quite near Relica. Fight
started. With just few attacks i was already dying.
</p>

<p>
Miracle happened. My cat dashed in! She started to scratch the lizard. Lizard
attacked the cat and i was able to dash out to try my strange new spell which i
do not remember anymore. Cat scratched lizard again and i was surprised to
read - lizard had troubles. I put my weapon to my inventory and started to hold
a mysterious scroll on my shaking hands. Cat and lizard were fighting.
</p>

<p>
Cat could dodge all attacks. Soon lizard was dying. Finally i managed to start
cast my strange energy attack scroll. AKRAKADABRA! When bolt finally landed to
the lizard it was already dead due to my cat scratching it. So, i was happily
saved by my cat :slight<sub>smile</sub>:    &#x2013; <i>joni75</i>

<li><b>/dropsame</b> which will drop all items in your inventory that have a matching
item on the same tile. If you are standing on an empty tile, this command

commands</li>

list.</li>

clicking them them on the Targets list</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-13-4-1-9">
<p>
Well met, travelers!
Public Alpha 16 is here, and with it come some HUGE changes to the core mechanics of FARA. Combat and dying have been overhauled, and many other facets have been adjusted with the goals of encouraging exploration and smoothing game progression. I want to give a special thanks to the volunteers in our awesome Discord community for testing these changes over the last month. FARA is so much better because of your thoughtful feedback and gigantic brains. The notes presented below are but a fraction of what this update has to offer. FARA is a game about exploration after all, so I encourage you to start a new adventure and discover all the new goodies for yourself!
</p>
</div>



<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org8e3bc1f"></a>BLIGHTS:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-1-9-1">
<p>
This update adds a little more flair to the concept of permadeath with the introduction of the Blight mechanic. Instead of immediately perishing when dealt a killing blow, you now have the option to be resurrected with a permanent difficulty modifier. These modifiers, or blights, range from stat reductions to increased encounter rate. You have the option to accept a blight every time you die, but the chances of successfully resurrecting are lowered based on the number of blights you have.
</p>

<p>
As FARA grows in scope and presents new long-term progression options for players, the idea of permadeath as it existed seemed harsh and out of place. With the blight system, players should feel more empowered to explore and grow with the same character without the threat of their first mistake completely wiping out all of the time and resources they've invested in their worlds.
</p>
</div>
</li>



<li><a id="orgc9449aa"></a>COMBAT:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-1-9-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Variable speeds for most combat actions have been removed, making combat feel more turn-based. For every action you perform, all other combatants will also perform a single action.</li>

<li>Added a /dash action. Dashing allows entities to move across multiple tiles in a single moment at the cost of stamina. Max dash distance is determined, among other factors, by Finesse. Dashing can also be performed by holding Shift and using the arrow keys. Releasing the Shift key will perform the dash.</li>

<li>Added ~10 new unique heavy attack effects, including unique effects for Insight-based weapons</li>

<li>Swapping two held items is now a free action which does not use a turn.</li>

<li>Weapon size no longer plays a role in damage output or speed.</li>

<li>Heavy attack stamina usage is now determined by the wielder's proficiency in the weapon's 'needed' stat.</li>

<li>Reduced the duration of most effects, buffs, and debuffs by ~75%. Because of the changes to action speed, effects still expire at roughly the same point in a combat encounter.</li>

<li>Most common damage-over-time effects now tick every moment instead of every ~5. Because of the duration reductions, they still deal about the same amount of total damage.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>



<li><a id="orga5175f4"></a>EXPLORATION &amp; CRAFTING:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-1-9-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added some new items and NPCs in settlements to aid in resource management and exchanges</li>

<li>Removed hunger and thirst</li>

<li>Increased the likelihood of finding items and NPCs of interest when exploring local areas</li>

<li>Reduced encounter chance when moving on the world map</li>

<li>Common enemies now have a chance to drop crafting resources</li>

<li>Increased starting inventory size from 20 to 25</li>

<li>Increased Hidden Pocket inventory bonus from 2 to 5</li>

<li>Simplified the crafting requirements of many weapons and tools</li>

<li>Increased the material cost Workbenches and gave them the ability to repair all personal items at once</li>

<li>Removed a big chunk of the starting recipes and dramatically increased the likelihood of finding items/recipes you don't have</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>



<li><a id="org3439649"></a>CLASS CHANGES:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-1-9-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Illusionist: Removed Blink spell and replaced it with Prestige, an ability which allows the caster and target to switch places</li>

<li>Juggernaut: Their /dash causes damage to encountered obstacles</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>



<li><a id="orgcea7701"></a>NEW LAYOUT OPTIONS:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-1-9-5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added 2 new interface layout options which can be enabled with /layout2 (also known as /bigmap) and /layout3. They can be particularly helpful for those who wish the minimap was larger:</li>
</ul>

<p>
Layout 1 (default):
Layout2:
Layout 3:
</p>
</div>
</li>


<li><a id="org1ec06ee"></a>MISCELLANEOUS:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-1-9-6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Made some substantial engine optimizations. The game should run much, much better in crowded environments.</li>

<li>Mouseover tooltips can now be disabled with /tooltips.</li>

<li>Arcane Obelisks in settlements now have infinite uses.</li>

<li>Autoloot is now enabled by default. If you've played FARA before, you might need to manually turn this setting on with /autoloot, or via the /settings menu.</li>

<li>FINALLY updated some of the outdated information under /help and /define</li>

<li>Fixed a crash caused by butchering fish</li>

<li>Fixed an issue with blight spells (now called plagues) lasting forever</li>

<li>Fixed a crash caused by /define</li>

<li>Fixed all sorts of typos</li>

<li>Added new typos</li>
</ul>



<p>
As is the case with every update regardless of size, starting up a new adventure is strongly recommended over trying to load an older save. In this case, trying to load anything older than 0.0.16 won't even work.
</p>

<p>
Good luck out there, travelers!

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org2998a60"></a>2021.02.13 Patch Notes<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-13-4-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Removed several unfinished settlement facilities. They will make a return when they actually do something. For now, every settlement has the same 5 facilities, and they are always in the same style of building.</li>
<li>Finished the Warehouse facility</li>
<li>Added a /recipe 'itemname' command which lists the components of a specified known recipe. Can also be performed with /rcp.</li>
<li>Added a /deletetitle command for permanently removing earned titles from the /factions window</li>
<li>Added 'Repair' as a mouse menu option when possible</li>
<li>Updated castle Nobles to fall more in line with the quest behavior of settlement Elders. One notable difference is that the completion or failure of noble quests will affect faction reputation. For now, the quest types are the same ones you know and love, with the goal of having faction-specific quest types in the future.</li>
<li>Inspecting bags now unlocks recipes for the next size/type of bag.</li>
<li>The /repair command can now utilize Repair Kits on the ground as long as they're within reach.</li>
<li>Made unknown landmarks more obvious when traversing the world map</li>
<li>If you've been having input issues and have a game controller connected to your computer, you may now use /ignorecontrollers to (hopefully) fix any problems.</li>
<li>Typing '/inspect all' will now inspect all items on your target list. Each inspection still counts as a complete action, and the sequence will be interrupted if you take damage.</li>
<li>Updated the criteria for which character deaths/retirements are announced on Discord</li>
<li>The character sheet now properly shows attunements after death</li>
<li>Fixed a long-standing issue with NPCs taking 1 more moment than the player to perform any action. The fix for the this was suspiciously easy, so I'm positive I've broken something. Let me know what you find!</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented Traders from working as intended</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the /autosave setting from persisting after reload. Note, this is different from the forced saves that take place after certain game events. Forced saves cannot be disabled.</li>
<li>Fixed several instances of jank looking fireworks when /bigmap is enabled</li>
<li>Fixed several instances of map cursors lingering longer than they should</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which prevented the manifestation of a second minor trait if you had a major trait</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with cavern entities such as chests and nodes crowding the cavern entrance instead of being spread throughout the cavern.</li>
<li>Fixed a game crash caused by the Giant Swing ability</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with certain entities not showing up on the target list at the proper distances</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused several craftable items to be described as 'wood' when they weren't</li>
<li>So many optimizations</li>
</ul>

<li><a id="org8224f0b"></a>2021.02.10 Patch Notes<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-13-4-2-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Repair Kits are now stackable, single use, and have a different recipe.</li>
<li>Added a /repair command which will use a Repair Kit on a specified item</li>
<li>Arguments for the /targetfilter command can now be preceeded with a '-' to exclude certain results, i.e. '/targetfilter -tree' will filter out all trees from the target list.</li>
<li>Fixed some crashes related to items which are no longer available</li>
<li>Fixed NPC Politicians not being able to use their ability</li>
<li>Fixed some display issues with the health and stamina bars</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-13-4-2-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added a /bigmap layout, which shifts some interface elements around to accommodate a much larger, centralized mini(?)map. Enabling this layout will also trigger some other interface changes which can be controlled individually:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>/reverselog which switches the direction and order of game log messages. The most recent event will be at the top.</li>
<li>/objectivewindow which is a new window in the upper left for tracking active quests</li>

<li>Adjusted Plague Doctor: The negative conditions they spread now affect targets for twice the duration of the original effect</li>
<li>Replaced several chest types with more generous versions</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-13-4-2-31">
<p>
Long time no see, travelers!
</p>

<p>
It's been 568 days since FARA's last public update, but that isn't to say the
project has been dormant. A dedicated, intrepid group of adventurers has been
testing a rebuilt version of the game since July, and that test-of-a-test is now
ready for everyone to&#x2026; test. There have been well over 120 patches in that
time, and what's listed below is a summary of the highlights. If by chance you
want to read every raw, potentially spoilery, nitty gritty detail without much
context, you can find

</ul>

<p>
I want to give my most heartfelt thanks to everyone invited to test the changes
over the last few months. You could have spent that time and energy on anything,
and the fact you chose to help make FARA a better game means the world to me.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org4c793c0"></a>SUMMARY:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-2-31-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The biggest goal of this update was to re-write many of FARA's underlying systems and data structures. In doing so, the game should run faster and scale better with future development. There are also a TON of bug fixes, gameplay changes, and usability improvements. If you've tried FARA in the past and spent more time fighting the interface than monsters, I encourage you to give this new build a shot.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org1b6ab44"></a>INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-2-31-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can now hold down the arrow keys to continuously move in a direction. Additionally, you can click and drag from the center of the screen to activate a virtual joystick and move around.</li>

<li>There is now an interact button in the target window which can either be clicked to perform the displayed action, or at least inform you of what action pressing [ Enter ] will perform.</li>

<li>Right-clicking in the center of the screen now presents the same target options as clicking on the target window. Holding the right mouse button down while scrolling the mouse wheel will cycle through targets.</li>

<li>Hovering the mouse over objects on the map will display what they are, and clicking an object will target it and bring up a list of options.</li>

<li>Added more bump-to-interact options. Bumping into foliage will harvest it, bumping into large ore nodes will attempt to mine them, bumping into non-hostile NPCs will /interact with them.</li>

<li>Added drag and drop! Dragging objects from the Nearby Targets window and dropping them on your inventory or the game log will attempt to /take them. Dragging items in your possession and releasing them on the game log will /drop them. Dragging items in your possession and releasing them on your target will attempt to /give the item. You can also drag items between your holding, wearing, and inventory windows.</li>

<li>Added tooltips! You can now hover your cursor over most objects and targets to learn about them.</li>

<li>Added animations! Several (mostly combat-related) actions now have animated effects which will play over the target window or the center of the screen.</li>

<li>Added a new interface for building structures. Press [ b ] or type /build with Wooden Blocks near by to create buildings one room at a time instead of tile by tile.</li>

<li>The health and stamina bars are now displayed by default.</li>

<li>All of the most frequently used pop-up windows (/character, /spells, /recipes, etc) now have tabs along the top, allowing quick access to the other frequently viewed windows. Continuously pressing [ c ] will cycle through all of the windows.</li>

<li>Clicking on party members now displays options to view their stats, items, and spells.</li>

<li>Pressing [ - ] now opens a window which shows the entire local map. If you are in a dungeon or somewhere similar, this map will only show areas you have seen. This feature can also be accessed by clicking the header of the minimap or typing /map.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orga07a51f"></a>GAMEPLAY CHANGES:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-2-31-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There is now a static settlement named Relica near the start of an adventure. The further you travel from Relica, the more difficult (and rewarding) the game becomes. There are still randomly generated settlements, but they are few and far between.</li>

<li>Added fast travel, accessed by either clicking a waypoint or typing /travel (waypoint number). If you are tracking a waypoint, you can also click on the compass.</li>

<li>Most randomness has been removed from combat. There are no longer chances to miss or crit - both will happen consistently when the right conditions are met. Elemental weapons will always trigger their effects with heavy attacks and never on regular attacks. Elemental spells will always trigger their effects with every cast.</li>

<li>Jumping while targeted by an attack will cause you to dodge the attack. In the case of a spell, you will take half the spell's normal damage and avoid any secondary effects.</li>

<li>Ranged weapon attacks now has a reload penalty which adds time to your next action</li>

<li>Stamina now regenerates over time, and is more of a per-encounter resource than a per-rest resource. Heavy attacks and jumping/dodging use considerably more stamina than before.</li>

<li>The gap between the lowest and highest health classes has been narrowed. Classes now either have slightly below average health, average, or slightly about average health.</li>

<li>Most of the primary stats have been renamed, and their purposes tweaked:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Strength: Increases damage dealt with melee weapons and unarmed strikes, decreases stamina spent pushing large objects</li>
<li>Finesse: Increases damage dealt with ranged weapons, increases chance to disarm traps, increases stealth ability, decreases reload time of ranged weapons, decreases stamina use of jumping and stealth</li>
<li>Resilience: Reduces physical damage taken, reduces duration of negative effects, increases stamina regeneration rate</li>
<li>Insight: Increases damage of spells, increases search ability, decreases stamina cost of spells</li>
<li>Charm: Increases the duration of positive effects, increases odds of favorable outcomes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wisdom has been removed</li>

<li>Added equipment slots - Head, Body, Hands, Feet, and Accessory. Typical equipment will fit into one of the slots. The accessory slot retains the old behavior of allowing anything* to be equipped there.</li>

<li>Added a trait system. Traits add passive bonuses and features to your character. There are 3 types - Master, Major, and Minor. Master traits are determined by your class and cannot be changed. Major and Minor traits can be acquired from different factions as rewards for helping them. You can have 1 Major trait and 2 Minor traits.</li>

<li>Added several new enemies, encounter types and scenarios</li>

<li>Dungeons have been reworked to produce more interesting layouts, and new kinds of obstacles have been added</li>

<li>Randomly generated factions have been removed in favor of 3 static factions - the Radiant Hand, the Jade Circle, and the Wild of the Wild. There is a lot in store for the faction system, but for now, they serve as the primary means of acquiring traits.</li>

<li>World biome distribution is far more logical and aesthetically pleasing than before.</li>

<li>Meals are now stackable, provide rejuvenation, and only use a single ingredient. Cooking multiple items on a fire will produce multiple meals.</li>

<li>Crafting materials have been rebalanced across the board. A handful have been removed, and several new ones have been added.</li>

<li>You can no longer craft unknown objects for twice the material cost. Instead, inspecting an item will teach several related recipes.</li>

<li>The default maximum party size has been reduced from 4 to 2.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org27f6fea"></a>CLASS CHANGES:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-2-31-4">
<p>
Blacksmith, Brewmaster, Tailor, Spelunker, Constable, Astronomer, and Yogi have been removed. Their abilities and features have been added to other classes.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added Mortician! Ability: Undertaking: Morticians have access to the Fervent Embalming spell which raises corpses to fight for a short duration. Additionally, Morticians do not attract hostile targets when resting outdoors, and gain a bonus to all stats and vision at night.</li>

<li>Added Peasant! Peasants have terrible stats across the board and can't use magic. If you wanted FARA to be more challenging, here's your Expert Mode.</li>

<li>Spellthief: They now have an active ability to learn the last ability to affect them instead of automatically learning everything</li>

<li>Adventurer has been reworked: "Adventurers have an increased chance to find rare items. They also have the Heroic Feat ability which provides a temporary boost to all stats once per rest."</li>

<li>Pit Fighter has been reworked: "Pit Fighters have heightened stamina regeneration when bleeding, dazed, or immobilized. They also have the Payback ability which deals damage to a target in melee range equal to twice the most recent damage received and causes bleeding."</li>

<li>Duelist has been reworked: "Duelists gain Opportunity after perfectly timed dodges, allowing their next action to be performed without using stamina. They also have the En Garde ability which increases the Duelist's damage against a selected target while amplifying damage the Duelists receives from other sources."</li>

<li>Executioner has been reworked: "Executioner's killing blows deal splash damage and knock adjacent targets to the ground. They also have the Last Word ability which deals heavy damage to targets who are Dying."</li>

<li>Juggernaut has been reworked: "Juggernauts are immune to immobilization and force spells, deal twice as much damage to non-sentient objects, knock down hostile targets after jumping, and can smash through most doors."</li>

<li>Gatekeeper has been reworked: "Gatekeepers will deflect long-range projectiles, and their shields and armor take less damage in combat. They also have the Protect ability which temporarily reduces the amount of damage a target takes by half."</li>

<li>Soldier has been reworked: "Soldiers gain increased damage resistance as their health decreases."</li>

<li>Kung Fu Master has been reworked: "Standard attacks trigger Bear Stance, causing thier next heavy attack to inflict Dazing. Heavy attacks trigger Monkey Stance, causing thier next jump to grant Quickness. Jumping triggers Tiger Stance, causing their next standard attack to inflict bleeding."</li>

<li>Fishmonger has been reworked: "Fishmongers cannot drown, take greatly reduced damage while Intoxicated and are immune to the negative effects, and have a higher chance to catch rare items while fishing."</li>

<li>Elemancer has been reworked: "Elemancers have a bonus to all elemental attunements. They also have the Attune ability which channels the elemental energy of a target to boost the caster's relative attunement. Successfully casting the ability a second time will combine the elements, providing two boosts at half the potency. Attunements are lost after rest."</li>

<li>Scholar has been reworked: "Scholars gain Enlightenment after conversing with someone or learning a new recipe, temporarily increasing their insight. Scholars can cast spells from scrolls at higher tiers based on their insight, and can use the same scroll several times."</li>

<li>Gamber has been reworked: "Gamblers have access to the 'Gamble' ability which inflicts a random negative condition to either the caster or their target. Charm reduces the stamina cost of this ability and increases the likelihood of afflicting the target over the caster. When used on certain chests, Gamble will either upgrade the quality of the chest or completely destroy it."</li>

<li>Ragamuffin has been reworked: "Ragamuffins have an increased chance to steal successfully, and can find a wider variety of items. In combat, Ragamuffins can attempt to /steal weapons used to attack them."</li>

<li>Kunoichi has been reworked: "When attacking from stealth, Kunoichi deal bonus damage and remain hidden if the attack kills their target. Additionally, Kunoichi recover from the Revealed effect twice as quickly, and gain Quickness when Revealed."</li>

<li>Gamestalker has been reworked: "Gamestalkers immobilize targets when attacking from stealth at range."</li>

<li>Demon Slayer has been reworked: "Demon Slayers take reduced damage from legendary monsters and spells, and silence enemies with their heavy attacks."</li>

<li>Wrestler has been reworked: "Wrestlers can use the Giant Swing ability, allowing them to throw a target to an area of their choosing, causing them to take damage, land prone, and become Dazed. Additionally, Wrestlers are immune to being dazed, and do not receive any penalties while prone."</li>

<li>Bodybuilders have been reworked: "Bodybuilders have access to the Flex ability which will blind a hostile target. If completely unarmored, Flex will also provide a temporary Charm bonus and cleanse negative status effects."</li>

<li>Kensai has been tweaked: In addition to their Samurai Showdown ability, they now instantly counter-attack after performing a perfect dodge.</li>

<li>Illusionist has been reworked: "Illusionists will immediately enter stealth for a short duration when damaged by a critical hit. Additionally, Illusionists detect illusions and disguises without fail."</li>

<li>Rift Dancer has been reworked: "A Rift Dancer's heavy attacks and spells summon creatures from other planes."</li>
</ul>

<p>
Saying there is more to the update than what is listed above would be the understatement of a lifetime. While I could have gone into greater detail, let's not forget that FARA is a game about exploration and discovery. Adventure awaits!

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-13-4-4-2">
<p>
The first public alpha for FARA was released one year ago today! I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who's taken the time to try FARA out and provide feedback. This game wouldn't be even half of what it is today were it not for the enthusiastic, welcoming, and dedicated community which has built up over the last year. I've wanted to be a game dev since I was a kid, and the FARA community has made that dream more fulfilling than I ever thought possible. You all have been incredible, and I look forward to the continued discourse that has shaped the game into something so many people find enjoyable. Now, let's celebrate the occasion by making the game way harder:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Key Fragments no longer resurrect the player when killed.</li>
<li>Added a new innate spell to the player character - Astral Blessing. This ability expends ALL collected Key Fragments to completely restore health, stamina, and mood. Astral Blessing also bestows several positive effects for a moderate duration, removes all hunger and thirst, and damages nearby enemies.</li>
<li>Started working on some public leaderboard stuff. When a character of notable achievement dies, retires, slays a dungeon boss, or completes the Astral Key, an announcement will be made in the FARA Discord (<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn">https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn</a>). You can set a username ingame with /setusername yourname. You can opt out of this feature with /eventsharing.</li>
<li>Increased the importance of dexterity for reliably hitting targets with ranged weapons</li>
<li>Removed the strength bonus from ranged weapon damage</li>
<li>Made some changes to the start of the game</li>
<li>Removed wooden planks from the game and adjusted crafting recipes for objects which used them</li>
<li>Individual keybindings can now be reset with '/setkey keytochange default'</li>
<li>Made an adjustment which should make it a little easier to build shelters when you have allies following you</li>
<li>Typing /define without specifying any text wil now show all glossary entries.</li>
<li>Non-sentient entities can no longer be knocked prone.</li>
<li>Fixed several broken commands issued via mouse menu</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which prevented the [ z ] key from being re-bound</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which allowed certain monster abilities to work on slain entities</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that allowed traps be salvaged with /salvageall.</li>
<li>Fixed (more) issues with the Pounce ability</li>
<li>Fixed an edge case with Elder riddles which allowed duplicates of certain answers</li>
<li>Fixed a crash caused by entering castles</li>
</ul>

<p>
A fresh game is required in order to continue regular play.

<li>Added a new class, the Bloodweaver! Unique Ability: Hemophiliancy - Bloodweavers have access to the Blood Pact spell which places a Sigil of Blood on a target. This sigil slowly grows in potency over time, dealing increased damage while increasing the power of the target. Casting Blood Pact on a target affected by Sigil of Blood will transfer the sigil to the caster while retaining its potency level. Casting Blood Pact on target while affected by Sigil of Blood will transfer the existing sigil to the target. Only one Sigil of Blood may be active at a time.</li>
<li>Reworked Beekeeper. Unique Ability: Hiveminded - When Beekeepers interact with beehives, they become swarmed by a mass of bees which they can command using the Send Bees and Call Bees abilities. Beehives of different materials produce different kinds of swarms. Beekeepers have no additional materials cost for building unknown hive types, and are immune to the negative effects of swarms.</li>
<li>Made some adjustments to the Elemancer class:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reduced health to Below Average</li>
<li>The trigger chance for elements on their armor is now based on the quality of the armor</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reduced the size/weight of common fruits and vegetables</li>
<li>Reduced the material cost of shelters</li>
<li>Masterwork items can no longer harness two elements. Artifacts remain the same.</li>
<li>Travelling unstealthed in the overworld no longer uses stamina. Traveling stealthed uses stamina and takes twice as long.</li>
<li>Increased the rate at which hunger and thirst build while travelling the overworld</li>
<li>Reworked animal mounting. Potential mounts must now be tamed with a saddle before they can be ridden. The quality of the saddle as well as several other factors determine the likelihood of successfully taming an animal. Equestrians get a bonus to tame attempts.- Entities now also have a chance to be knocked from their mount when struck.</li>
<li>Entities can no longer trigger elemental effects via self-targeted skills and abilities.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the Quests &amp; Reputation menu option from displaying correctly</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused the bleeding effects caused by Pit Fighters to last longer than intended</li>
</ul>

<p>
NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 14:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All items and materials have had their stats rebalanced, and 4 new materials have been added. Generally speaking, achieving extremely high stats takes more planning than before, and fights should last a little longer with (slightly) fewer unexpected damage spikes.</li>
<li>The dexterity stat has been completely reworked, and with it comes a few changes to combat:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The dodge chance provided by dexterity now only applies when moving or jumping. This means that in order to be successful with a dexterous character, you actually need to move around as you fight.</li>
<li>Dexterity now reduces the stamina cost of jumping, and the cost of jumping has been slightly increased.</li>
<li>High dexterity is now critical for reliably disarming traps and using stealth</li>
<li>The "enemy blocked your movement even though you weren't going that way" mechanic has been removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Charisma now increases the duration of positive effects in addition to reducing the duration of negative ones.</li>
<li>Intelligence now reduces the cost of most spells instead of Wisdom</li>
<li>Constitution and Wisdom are now more effective at reducing physical and elemental damage respectively.</li>
<li>Added a new item type: Reinforcements. Reinforcements can be added to other items to increase certain stats or grant advantages to certain actions.</li>

<li>Added speed information to attack messages</li>
<li>Added [ ? ] as a hard-coded shortcut to open /help</li>
<li>Added several new encounter types and revamped the Caravan encounter</li>
<li>Added 2 new weapon types</li>
<li>Revamped the /inventory command to show a detailed list of all your possessions. The default shortcut is [ shift + i ].</li>
<li>Reworked the /accomplishments screen to provide a little more detail about your deeds, and expanded it beyond quest completions. Entries will also be generated for title acquisitions, defeating legendary beasts, etc.</li>
<li>Pigments and Scribe Chests have been removed from the game, and instead areas can be marked freely with the new /mark (color) command. Areas can be cleaned with /clearmark.</li>
<li>Fleshed out the noise system a bit. If something is moving nearby and you can't see it, you might still hear it.</li>
<li>Allies can now be instructed to ride animals</li>
<li>The darkness effect now increases the mood of the attacker in addition to draining the mood of the target</li>

<li>Updated several /help and /define entries</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-4-15-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Pit Fighter: When critically hit, Pit Fighters gain the Payback effect, which grants bonus damage to their next attack based on the amount of damage received.</li>
<li>Gamestalker: Gamestalkers now deal more damage the farther away their target is, and their accuracy trait has been removed</li>
<li>Juggernaut: The knockdown effect of the Juggernaut's movement now interrupts the actions of those affected.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Added two new quest types</li>
<li>Reworked Kensai. Unique Ability: Samurai Showdown - Kensais have access to the Samurai Showdown ability which dashes to a targeted area at imperceivable speeds. Enemies along the path receive the [Already Dead] effect which deals damage after a brief delay and grants fury to the Kensai. The damage and fury duration are determined by the number of enemies hit.</li>
<li>You can now tell party members to be/not be passive. While passive, party members will still defend themselves and their allies, but will not immediately attack anything you attack.</li>

<p>
As is usually required when there's a big update**,
a fresh game is required for everything to work properly,
and the game probably won't start at all if you attempt to load an older save.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org6d97d66"></a>NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 13:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-5-5-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This alpha release overhauls FARA's oldest, and quite frankly, most confusing system - combat:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Offensive attacks, defensive attacks, evasive attacks, balanced attacks, pushing, kicking, and parries have been removed in favor of just two attacks: Regular attacks ([ a ] or /attack) and Heavy attacks ([ shift + a ] or /attackheavy).</li>
<li>Regular attacks behave mostly like Balanced attacks from pre Alpha 13.</li>
<li>Heavy attacks tend to be slower, more powerful, use stamina, decrease weapon durability, and trigger special effects based on the weapon used. For instance, performing a heavy attack with a dagger or similar small blade will cause the attacker to leap backward evasively after the strike. Other heavy attacks can deflect projectiles, apply status effects, etc.</li>
<li>Entities gain most of the benefits provided by the removed Defensive/Evasive stances as long as they can see the attacker and are not performing any actions (including attacking)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added class-specific combat behaviors for NPCs. Gunslingers will jumping around to dodge ranged attacks, Alchemists will throw mixtures, etc.</li>
<li>Added ~10 new weapon types</li>
<li>Rebalanced the stats for several material and item types</li>
<li>Entities no longer need a target selected to attack. Attacking without a target will now just attack in the direction you are facing.</li>
<li>Made several changes to the stealth mechanic to award those who properly prepare for the occasion</li>
<li>Elemental Resistance has been changed to Elemental Attunement.  In addition to granting resistances, attunement also increases the potency of one's triggered elemental effects</li>
<li>Health and stamina bars now show the last instance of damage in a slightly faded color</li>
<li>Increased inventory capacity from 20 to 25</li>
<li>Reduced the damage of most melee weapons</li>
<li>Combative NPCs will now investigate strange noises they hear from unseen entities</li>
<li>Changed the Intoxicated condition - it now reduces attack accuracy while increasing charisma, constitution, and the chance to stumble after missing.</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-5-5-2">

<li>Gatekeeper - Reworked their unique ability: "Gatekeepers have a higher than usual chance to deflect projectiles and block moving enemies attempting to flee. Additionally, their shields and armor take less damage when struck."</li>
<li>Elemancer - They now received a bonus to all elemental attunements</li>
<li>Dervish - Whirling now prevents Dervishes from being interrupted by attacks</li>

<li>The maximum number of runes that can be in a spell has been reduced from 10 to 5.</li>
<li>All crafted spells now start at the same relative power tier</li>
<li>Learned spells can now be upgraded at Arcane Obelisks or via Obelisk Shards. Obelisks can be unlocked by completing settlement quests. Obelisks and shards can also be found scattered throughout the world.</li>
<li>Intelligence now plays a more important roll in spell damage.</li>
<li>Staves now reduce the stamina cost of spells</li>

<li><a id="orgbdfa547"></a>2019.03.02 Public Alpha 12 is LIVE - Mouse/Touch Support!<br />
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org900ff07"></a>NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 12:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-6-8-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This alpha release introduces a pretty big game-changer regarding accessibility - FARA can now enjoyed with a mouse or touchscreen! As much as I love writing beefy changelogs, the changes are pretty simple:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Clicking/tapping objects on the side panels will display a tiny* menu with various contextual actions</li>
<li>Clicking anywhere in the central game log or status section will provide access to more general commands and features</li>
<li>Clicking on a map tile will now move your character toward that tile. If you're in a local area, you'll zip right to the targeted location in one click. If you're on the world map, you'll move one tile in the direction of the cursor. Clicking the center tile will search the area.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org6be8fda"></a>QUALITY OF LIFE AND OTHER CHANGES:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-6-8-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rebalanced health values across all classes. If your favorite class went from 'Above Average' to 'Average' health, it doesn't necessarily mean the value is lower than before. Additionally, the classifications of health no longer vary between classes. Two classes with 'Above Average' health now have exactly the same amount.</li>
<li>Pressing the [ enter ] key will now trigger the /interact function with your target if the command prompt is closed.</li>
<li>Dramatically improved the pathfinding capabilities of NPCs.</li>
<li>Added richer descriptions and additional mouse menu options for those interested in playing with the UI disabled</li>
<li>Added /moveto command which pathfinds your way to a target</li>
<li>/takeall no longer picks up Supply Crates and Barrels</li>
<li>/salvage and /salvageall will now open all nearby Supply Crates and Barrels</li>
<li>Tweaked some things to make the game less frustrating for players who (for whatever reason) want to play the game on mobile devices. FARA still isn't exactly mobile-friendly and I still wouldn't recommend playing it on a phone if you can help it, but this patch should make such a thing far more possible, particularly on Android devices running Chrome.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the dexterity score of certain animals and monsters from being properly applied</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause cooking from the Quick Actions menu to cook the wrong item</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to destroying boulders</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause party members to rob you in your sleep. May re-add.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with climbing that allowed entities to remain elevated even if the climbed item was destroyed</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused commoners to suggest visiting the town you're already in</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause colosseum Champions to leave a life of glory behind in favor of murdering you in your sleep for no reason in particular</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that allowed abused Combat Dummies to cast aside their shackles and hunt down their oppressors</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-6-8-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Farming! It's pretty simple for now - drop a seed into a Hole and it'll turn into a Plot. After a day or so, your new plant(s) will shoot out of the ground.</li>

<li>More descriptive combat logs</li>
<li>Quests from Bounty Boards no longer disappear when accepted and can be abandoned and tracked again later.</li>
<li>Dramatically increased the performance of map animations with minimal* downsides</li>
<li>Butchering a salvaging now teach you about the objects/animals before dismantling them</li>
<li>Added an /exit command which will return the player to the world map from a local area. It can also be done with /leave.</li>
<li>Expanded the functionality of /interact</li>
<li>Added some friendly fire protection. Attacking a healthy party member once will no longer cause them to turn on you. Attacking them a second time within a certain time frame or while they are Injured or Dying will cause them to retaliate.</li>
<li>Overhauled the movement speed system and made the stat visible in the /character window</li>

As a friendly reminder, you can quickly exit local areas and settlements by typing /exit.</li>

<li>Started re-implementing town expansion.

the empty dirt plots as you complete quests.  Any entities on these plots when
the building spawns will be moved elsewhere or vaporized if there is nowhere
else for them to go.</li>

<li>Quests accepted from Bounty Boards and elsewhere are no longer removed from
their sources, and remain available even if abandoned.</li>

This one is a doozy. Where do I even start?

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org83e65d5"></a>NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 11:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-13-4-7-10-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Combat and object interactions have been removed from the overworld.
</p>

<p>
Most of the game now takes place at the zoom level once reserved for indoor
spaces and dungeons. While viewing the overworld map, press [ Enter ], [ e ],
or type /explore to drop down to the local level.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As you travel, you will happen upon encounters which automatically trigger
the local view. Having most the game take place at the local level offers
many new and exciting perks:</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Bump to attack!
Under most circumstances, living entities can no longer share the same map
tile. Among other things, this means you can now attack hostile targets by
simply walking into them.</li>

<li>Ranged weaponry in general is now much more viable.</li>

<li>Most interactions that required entities to be on the same tile can now
happen from 1 tile away.</li>

<li>The open spaces allow for more tactical combat. You can utilize terrain
features for cover, stand against large objects to avoid being surrounded, or
climb trees to get a better vantage.</li>

<li>NPC path-finding has been beefed up so they aren't so easily bested by trees
and building corners.</li>

<li>Area of effect spells have been reworked to take advantage of multiple tiles</li>

<li>The jumping mechanic has been reworked, and is now an indispensable tool
when dealing with attackers at range.</li>

<li>Settlements and encampments are now truly explorable areas.</li>

<li>Buildings as items have been removed, and instead players can craft walls and
floor tiles. Using these, you can create any building size and shape you want!</li>

<li>Rivers and ponds are no longer targetable objects, and are instead features
of the landscape you can walk up to and utilize.</li>

<li>Several classes have been tweaked to take advantage of the new mechanics and
space.</li>

<li>Added several new map effects to basic combat</li>

<li>Added pigments! Pigments allow you mark an area with a specific color, and can
be combined to produce every color under the rainbow.</li>

<li>Added a little color variety to the target dots on the map</li>

<li>Added party member items to the /compare window</li>

<li>Reworked the robbery mechanic to be a bit more engaging and straightforward</li>

<li>ADDED THE ABILITY TO PET ANIMALS</li>
</ul>

<p>
Getting all of the old systems up to speed is an ongoing effort, so expect a few
more related patches next week that address new issues like movement speed.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-13-4-8-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added ~50 new items</li>

<li>Added recipe items! Reading recipes will teach the reader how to create a
specified item.</li>

<li>Added a /salvageall command to salvage/butcher everything within reach. The
command will show in the Quick Actions menu when applicable, and can also be
done with /salvage all, /butcher all, and /butcherall.</li>

<li>Dramatically increased the variety of dungeon monsters with the new prefix
system. These prefixes should give players an idea of what areas a particular
monster may excel, and where they might be vulnerable.</li>

<li>Masterwork items may now be infused with up to two elements, granting the
effects and resistances of both elements.</li>

<li>Revamped the /define command to show multiple results and actually be helpful</li>

<li>So many bug fixes I actually stopped keeping track. If it was reported before
today, it's either been fixed or accepted as a feature.</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-13-4-8-2">
<p>
This is far and away the biggest update FARA has received since its public
release in May 2018, and I'd love your feedback. If you haven't already, please
consider joining us on Discord! <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn">https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn</a>
</p>

<p>
Finally, I want to give a BIG shout out to everyone in the FARA Discord who
helped test earlier versions of this release over the past two weeks. They
suffered tremendously so that you might suffer slightly less. These expansive
changes might have never seen the light of day were it not for their positive
feedback and encouragement, so thanks for taking the time to provide some top
notch insights. There is still plenty of in-game text that needs updating and
bugs that need squashing, so if you come across something that doesn't seem
quite right, be sure to let me know!

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-13-5">
<p>
<i>What little insight into this I have tells me that the danger</i>

</p>

<p>
Still..
</p>

<p>
The game, in alpha for many years now, and while holding the attention of a
loyal playerbase, has a developer's that stated expressly that 
maintaining save-game compatibility is not a priority at the moment.
</p>

<p>
Thus you are advised to go through the notrouble of downloading and
installing the game locally so that you will be able to finish games
in progress since using the web-version risks obliteration of your
save at any time!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-13-6-3">
<p>
To run this game in linux you need <b>sudo rights</b>. You probably have them.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://itch.io/t/1037279/i-cannot-run-it-on-sparky-linux">also posted on itch.io</a>
</p>

<p>
Go to the directory where you unpacked the game, then type
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo chown root:root chrome-sandbox
sudo chmod 4755 chrome-sandbox 
sudo chmod +x FARA 
</pre>

<p>
after that you can start the game using 
</p>

<pre class="example">
./FARA
</pre>

<p>
from there through the terminal. this may not work through your file-manager,
but you can make a little script that will make it work.
</p>

<p>
Again, from where you unpacked the game type:
</p>

<pre class="example">
echo ./FARA &gt;./fara 
sudo chmod +x ./fara
</pre>

<p>
There's no .desktop shipped with the game. If you know where these go on your
system, perhaps <b>~/.local/share/applications/</b> as on my system, you could
install it in the menu saving the following there as, say, fara.desktop:
</p>

<pre class="example">
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.1
Type=Application
Name="FARA"
GenericName="Open World Roguelike Sandbox"
Comment="The Roguelike that tries to do too much :)"
Exec={customize}/FARA
Categories=Games
</pre>

<p>
I just just bookmarked the path with my file-manager to make it work from there
through the little script above and didn't actually test the .desktop file I
conjured up for you.
</p>


<p>
Savegames will likely be found in <b>~/.config/FARA</b> where you can put them
under version control to experiment at will. The files are pretty large
so consider symlinking them to a place thats backed-up daily, not hourly.
</p>

<p>
The game plays well under X and if you have more CPU cores on your server than
on your workstation, give that a try. It complicated adjusting the window
position through a startup script, but you'll be fine. Disable <b>/uianimation</b>
and screen-shaking so you don't even notice that you're playing remotely.
</p>

<p>
If you're lazy like me, write a script to unzip the release and copy the
~2.8mb large 'resources/app.asar' from there to where you've installed the
runtime with the proper rights.

<p>
While not an open source application per se, with an
<a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> application such as FARA one can
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/219">always</a> count on having
<a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/javascript-compilation-epoch-ebfb7b5bb664">access</a>
to the code for personal perusal even under its 'All rights reserved' license.
</p>

<p>
Much like with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Flash</a>, you can easily
<a href="https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=app.asar">unpack</a>
the program, change the fonts and user interface to please you without any loss in performance.
</p>

<p>
Additionally with a

<a href="https://www.thaoh.net/prettyjs/">extra</a>

Compacted as the code is, you can't expect to do much but make whatever crashes
between minor release go away, but since you can do these things inside an hour,
learning a little bit about the way modern software ships
will let you glide past otherwise game-ending troubles that
sometimes still slip in on point releases.
</p>

<p>
In this sense, and within these limits I can tolerate dealing
with software that isn't really free and open. Besides, there's no game like
<a href="https://www.startpage.com/sp/search?query=developing+electron+apps+jetbrains">learning</a>
by <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">doing</a>.
</p>

<p>
This will make more sense to you once you've had your system and your data
destroyed and obsoleted by proprietary code a few times. Then you too might
appreciate the importance of free and open software and see the value of
acquiring <a href="https://eslint.org/">some</a> of the
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">basic technical skills</a>.

Anyway, if you want to mess with things, make sure to use <b>/stopreports</b>,
and do yourself the favor of never using this approach to cheat or to 
learn game secrets or you will ruin your own fun in this sweet sandbox.

<p>
So, if you have a problem, unpack, drag the index.html into chrome
and have a look at the <b>F12</b>

Pug's experiments suggest:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>FARA needs at least three concurrent threads to be performant
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Anything better than a Dual-core CPU will do!</li>
<li>With a Dual-core you'll see the game slow to ~half speed after ~24hrs play.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2.2+ GHZ will be tolerable through a long game.</li>
<li>4ish GB RAM for Chrome/Electron/FARA
(at most! usuall much less, no problem.)</li>
<li>Disk seems not important although running from ram helps a bit atm.</li>
</ul>

<p>
What's optimal? Anything Quad-core with DDR-4 RAM but DDR-3 will do.
The real key to good performance appears to be the size of your
