<p>
FARA does everything roguelikes could have done but never did; and I've played
them all. If you don't know what I'm talking about, visit !<a href="https://brianiscreative.itch.io/fara">FARA's Homepage</a>! and
take a look at these <a href="https://www.startpage.com/sp/search?query=FARA+Rougelike+youtube&amp;cat=video">game-play vids</a>.

This page has my notes about a game I hope to live to see thrive and bestow
riches upon riches upon its creator.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The is the start of 'rolling unannounced updates' via Github hosting.
</p>

<p>
I'm hosting these notes as a <a href="https://fara-pug.github.io/fara-pug/">web-page at github</a> now, but that looks really lame. But
fear not! With <a href="https://github.com/fara-pug/fara-pug/blob/main/index.md">github stylesheets</a> the notes look quite nice already. For the
full crazy, take a look at <a href="https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=emacs+org+mode+outline+youtube">some vids</a> then grab the source document <a href="https://github.com/fara-pug/fara-pug">from the
repo</a>.
</p>

<p>
To stay totally informed of my very random comings and going, enter
<a href="https://github.com/fara-pug.atom">https://github.com/fara-pug.atom</a> into your rss-feed reader. I like the <a href="https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=Feedbro+Reader">Feedbro
Reader</a>. Set the update interval to weekly so that you catch changes I make out
of the blue after having not been seen. (Also set "maximum items to keep" to 1)
</p>

<p>
Make sure you also subscribe to <a href="https://brianiscreative.itch.io/fara/devlog.rss">Brian's FARA RSS feed</a> to stay in touch with the
game's development! If you haven't, do it now!
</p>

<p>
As I'm incorporating more things gleaned and learned on the journey toward my
first win there's no need to announce anything on the Discord except your
significant contributions to this documentation.. or perhaps when I restructure
things and make a 'new release'.
</p>

<p>
<b>Catching up?</b> Want to see what changed in this document? <a href="https://github.com/fara-pug/fara-pug/commits/main">See the History</a> and
click the <b>bold</b> title of the entries you see for the geeky details.  If you
just want to see when new pages went live, <a href="https://github.com/fara-pug/fara-pug/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages">there's a list for that too</a>.
</p>

<p>
(If you must, but can't reach me via discord, make a quick account on github and
post a comment there. That's no bother and will reach me via email most
weeks. Enjoy!)

<h3 id="orgbbc2dbc"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Thanks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
There are many voices here from the discord, reddit, wiki that use "I", but
some of the sections are now entirely my own.  Thus if you think 'you said
that', you probably did - and have my thanks for it!
</p>

<p>
Thanks Mantecarl for helping me fill in several blanks and resolving many
of the questions I'd left in places!

<div id="outline-container-orgb96cfd4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb96cfd4"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Pug's Notes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Look, I wrote this!

<div id="outline-container-orgc8d51f4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc8d51f4"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Trick out your map!</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Use <b>/setlocalwaypoint</b> aka <b>/slw</b> at your spawn, at every house, donation
chest, and every last npc on the map. Greet NPC's and put their names into the
waypoint name. You'll be glad you did!
</p>

<p>
There are several buildings of which you'll want to expand at least the
warehouse within the first few weeks game-time. It offers a way to access quite
a bit of stuff from elsewhere. A local waypoint at the spawn and on the
warehouse donation chest will save you a lot of time.
</p>

<p>
"<b>W</b>" makes zooming around the local map quick and convenient. That is unless
there are doors, pets, npc, or even the well along the path. Its not perfect yet
but "<b>W</b>" is a huge help. Use <b>/slw</b> until it becomes a habit.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Where you keep your stuff is up to you!
</p>

<p>
But there's one thing you have to know: <b>WARNING</b> NEVER LEAVE ANYTHING ON THE
SPAWN tile! FARA's advanced teleportation mechanism creates an intense rush of
air as your body materializes &#x2013; and that scatters anything you might have left
there through the immediate area. Try it out.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I'm still learning to play the game and I have yet to win. But this is
my second run at it in 3 years and I find that starting as a horder with a base
in Relica is again teaching me what I don't need or want, and how to deal with
everything else. Here's the scoop on what works for me.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org23a70b3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org23a70b3"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.1</span> InShelter</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-1">
<p>
I build a 7x7 house around the elder and the spawn point, use <b>/dropall</b> where i
land and to be right next to a bed, a brazier and the door for the most restful
healing sleep in every settlement I open.
</p>

<p>
<b>THIS</b> is incredibly useful with local waypoints and I get a lot of mileage out
of it! The base layout takes 23 planks, 4 braziers and a door (2
wooden blocks)
</p>

<p>
In Relica I use this arrangement:

"There is nothing in any of my warehouses .. except in Relica's." - pug.
</p>

<p>
First off, I don't really like the slow interaction with the storage bins in the
warehouse. But I use them. I dont use scrolls but I keep them in a bin next to
the crucible because I already know that I will be desperate for them when I'm strong
enough to get myself into the best part of the game I know, dungeons!
</p>

<p>
I also don't need kites, beehives, birds-nests, folded notes, toyswords and other things
like that, but these too find their way into the warehouse. Out of sight, not out of mind.
</p>

<p>
After opening up the (Refinery) I wound up with oddities like Tin Fiddles and
Organs, Bone Spears and Goggles. I love the recipes, but instead of salvaging
them right away stash them in Relica's warehouse in a 3rd chest.
</p>

<p>
Ammo. I got tons of ammo of all kinds. Sometimes I use a ranged weapon and when
I'm done playing with them I keep one foe each ammo-type in a Storage box, Dumping the
ammo on the floor at that location.

In each new settlement you reach you will find a set of tools to enhance your
equipment's performance.. Search for them and you shall find these craftable
gems.
</p>

<p>
But don't rush. Form a party, discover things and get settled and strong-ish.
</p>

<p>
After a while you and your party can handle all the kill quests the elder hands
out, and you'll likely have a couple of waypoints to other settlement and NPC's
eager to see you killed while you escort them there. When you are ready to look
for those tools and recipes accept the escort and delivery quests to that new
locale and leave right after waking up from resting.
</p>

<p>
Once you found them and are done marveling at your good luck from arriving
alive, getting a unique item and finding the tools, make sure to /inspect, not
/salvage them.

<p>
After settling into the the new place, find a beach and grind runes in style.
</p>

<p>
Plan to stay at the beach/dig-site for a while. Put up a 5x5 with door and
brazier for the good-morning buff and go rune hunting in safety close to
home.
</p>

<p>
When you can make a second workbench, then when you have runes for rejuvenation
and/or other spells go back to 'questing with the elder' until you have at least
several iron pieces or whatever is best for your needs.
</p>

<p>
Take your workbench when you dig so you dont need to make repair kits. Your
enhanced shovel will stay sharp that way. If you get bored digging, repeat the
racket with a fishing-rod while staying in the same shelter. Perhaps you'll even
put up a fire-pit for some extra 'positive outcome boosting' charisma buffing
snacks! Oh, and have a rope on you, just in case.
</p>

<p>
I've heard that noone will mind if you dig up a graveyard from end to end dolled
up in your finest charisma boosting gear either. But I'll let you try it first!
Maybe after your next escort quest?

Shovel or Fishing rod, what do i know. Plus I'm <a href="#org7dcc86f">dubious about iron</a> as

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
<p>
Besides doing quests, I attempt to explore in a circle of ever greater distance
from Relica and by manually taking different paths through the rectangles
connecting settlements.
</p>

<p>
Keeping Relica in the center makes investing into it somewhat viable and
worthwhile, at least i think so atm. At least thats why I use the warehouses to
let all trinkets/trophies/seeds/flowers/meats/fruits drift back into Relica
through the crucibles accessed via local waypoints.
</p>

<p>
People in the advanced stages of the game talk about traveling 1200++ km from
relica, fighting unheard of monsters from unheard of dimensions while still
investing into Relica. So as you explore more of these notes keep in mind that
I'm just starting, know nothing, have yet to win the game and go beyond iron
equipment and a single godlike attribute. This game has great depth and
complexity.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-7">
<p>
FARA's difficulty is a gem. Yes, really. I don't know the formula, but like you,
I appreciate that the things you encounter in your travels seem to slowly get
harder 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the further away you have been</li>
<li>the more challenging the enemies you have ended</li>
<li>the better equipped/longer you have been in game</li>
<li>the more titles (achievments?) you have.</li>
</ul>

<p>
But unlike most games, FARA doesn't actually seem to be out to kill you as it
did in (what to me were) 'the nightmare versions' released some years ago.
</p>

<p>
Combat in FARA can be freaky cool, and as long as you prioritize survival over
your macho, you'll manage to escape and appreciate the insurance that having
even a single gulp of <a href="#orga30076c">water</a> with you for that one time where its quicker to
drink and dash than it is to walk. But there's always <a href="#org7871e85">this</a>.

Small things on the ground can be seen up to 5 spaces away in a straight line,

Thus if you're looking for flowers or lost items you can move in paralell lines
11 spaces apart, that means there are 10 spaces between your lines.

those hard to find small rare species you'll inevitably be tasked with

The first batch swiped 2021.04.06ish by scrolling backward in time a few months

These I grabbed recently. Who knows how much more great insight and conversation

<p>
A few things regarding charged rift particles:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First, you can create one by dropping one of each elemental rune and making a spell. This still is very painful, but it won't destroy your stuff and doesn't require an inert rift shard.</li>
<li>Second, on one recent run I found a commoner with a quest to procure a "rift beacon." Turns out you build this using CRPs.</li>
<li>Apparently, they're able to summon Redeemed Rift Beasts which don't appear to be limited by the party size limit</li>
<li>Probably the stats of the Redeemed Rift beasts scale of distance away from relica</li>
<li>They seem to have a days survived stat that's always equal to yours, no matter when you summoned them.</li>
<li>I wonder where you could find the recipe for the RB</li>
<li>it's kind of busted for castle raiding</li>
<li>No idea. Might try feeding Relica's blacksmith until they hit on the recipe. That's how I got a gold ingot recipe.</li>
<li>Trader chests also sometimes come with recipes</li>
<li>Maybe take 3 CRPs to a Summoning Circle?</li>

<p>
Your charm doesn't increase your ability to lead a party and it does
not affect your party's maximum size. (max party size may be class dependent)
</p>

<p>
Charm does make it easier to form good relationships with NPCs, meaning that
with more charm <b>/joke</b>, <b>/gossip</b>, etc. will be better received and they
will think you more of a friend for doing quests for them.
</p>

<p>
Unsure how that matters. Will they remember your birthday? Give more loot?
</p>

<p>
More important.. If charm is luck and insight searching, then why isn't everyone
talking about making shovels and fishing-rods from crystal or even obsidian?
I think some testing is in order.. Can it be that people don't like setting up
house on the beach? Whats going on there..

When you get enough faction reputation by, for example bribing one of their
officers with 10..100 medals, you get access to their theme of traits, which
give some very good bonuses.
</p>

<p>
It is technically possible to get traits from multiple factions, but it requires
some grind as each medal given to a faction will decrease your reputation with
the other two. You can also try to do some Reputation juggling by getting the
Diplomat trait and/or being the Politician class to max rep on more than one
faction at a time
</p>

<p>
Check Faction trait lists through the <b>/factions</b> (aka "<b>F</b>") window by clicking on the
faction to get a menu to show you the available traits and their cost in shards.

I read that each new shard contibutes more points to your score than the previous one.

<p>
Thus if you aim to level up your stats by putting shards into them you should do
it with the 9th shard so that you collect the most unlock points for doing that.

If you're strong enough to move to another settlement, can you turn your naked

there are 5 primary stats. lets say they average '10 of 20'. you'd need 50 9th
shards to become a god. that's 500 new animal species discovered, and maybe 500
days spent in game.

hmm, lol, i wonder how long brute-forcing 10 find-animal quests would take and
if i could resist the urge to just complete the key to be done with the game.

There are eight types of damage in FARA.
</p>

<p>
Physical attacks are countered by "Damage Reduction" provided those held shield
items in combination with Resilience and Strength, i suppose.
</p>

<p>
Magical attacks are countered by your elemental attunement which is enhanced by
your Insight? and a shield spell. Did I get that right?

Elemental runes on your weapon give you a bonus and weaken your target.
</p>

<p>
If you have more than one elemental rune on your weapon, then they will
alternate with each hard attack you make.
</p>

<p>
FARA canon seems to be to use a single water-rune on your weapon and nothing
else since a little bit of extra water-attunement will make your rejuvenating
healing spell work ever so much better for you &#x2013; and of course weaken your
foe's water/healing attunement as well.

(expert info is on the way)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>See <a href="#org7017f46">8.1.2.4</a> for Spell-levels and leveling</li>
</ul>

<p>
Basically, you
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>chose an elemental rune to determine what type of damage and what elemental
effect it does,</li>
<li>a “stabilizer” to determine what type of spell it is (long range, AoE, etc)
and</li>
<li>an effector rune to apply additional effects when you cast it (like blinding
enemies, getting buffs on yourself, etc</li>
</ul>

<p>
More:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Spell type + 2 elements + effect  adds random stabilizer</li>
<li>If you don't use any elemental runes, only a stabilizer and effector, you get an arcane spell</li>
<li>You can put 2 spells on weapons and armor.  (scrolls /use</li>
<li>Curse spell + any damaging spell is a really good combo to get</li>
<li>in case you want to know spear and blade are generally considered good spells</li>
</ul>

<p>
Shielding:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Two elements (preferably including water)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>rune of shields + rune of rejuvenation gives what I consider the best spell in the game.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Because shield increases attunement to all elements, but does so more so for
the elements included in its spell. This makes it so you can max an attunement
with a shield of that element + 3(? 2? it's been a while since I played) runes
on Masterwork equipment.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-5-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's recommended to use a Rune of Rejuvenation</li>
<li>More water attunement = more healing on water-infused-weapon heavies</li>
<li>Rejuvenation is very powerful and you only seem to need a single rune to make
a spell from it. (powerful subject to ..insert yeah long disclaimer here &lt;g&gt;)</li>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org3b6620c"></a>Water Chain of Rejuvenation<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-5-1-1">
<p>
I wound up making a "Water Chain of Rejuvenation" and upgraded it using Obelisk
Shards until it became "Flawless". Its not that great with my stats yet but it
doubles as an offensive spell which keeps enemies where they are while i heal a
little every turn for a few turns. It might be awesomer for a ranged class to
use chain spells, but its good enough to keep melee guys from ganging up on me
too badly.
</p>

<p>
I know you experts out there are saying to yourselves.. what an idiot, doesn't
he know.. and I want to stop you right there! I know its not perfect, but its
fine to have to drop an item from your pack if there's not anything else in
range for you to cast the chain on.
</p>

<p>
Anyway.. I had no shield runes when I made the spell 50 days ago. And I still
don't have one, nor did I get another rejuvenation rune since. So if you like
hoarding to figure things out, try not to be stupid about it, these things are
meant to be used .. and you can always spend a week fishing and digging at a
beach. I will ;)

The second kind of is obviously better and rarer and I get the sense that the
someone who makes them was more likely to use his or her rarest runes on them so
that they could learn their complicated spells at will in the future. But as all
of the uncommon runes seem rarest to me at this point, I can't judge that right.

I read that you can rest on mats. that's not true.
</p>

<p>
You need/want
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a whatever bed, unsure that materials provide boni to sleep</li>
<li>to be within the glow of a brazier (what else works?)</li>
<li>to be behind any kind of door.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now&#x2026; if you find a blanket or a pillow count yourself lucky!
</p>

<p>
Pillows need feathers.. and the only way i can imagine getting any feathers is
from a bird joining battle, angered by my taking their nest of of their tree.
i've been collecting nests, but so far no angry birds.
</p>

<p>
I found the pillow recipe, so those exists; atm blankets may or may not exist,
speculating that they do because coolness. i dont really expect the buffs to get
stronger with pillow and blanket, but this was just an excuse to remind you of
the three easy things you want to do to get buffed sleeping: bed/heat/door.
</p>

<p>
In the end i got so mad at the useless nests however that I started kicking them
out of their trees, well, kindof. Now I have my pillows!

<li>source: <a href="https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Crafting_Materials">https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Crafting_Materials</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
There is an abundance of different materials and most of them seem to be
associated with some kind of stat altering capabilities, that you can gain by
wearing or holding the item. In addition to the material you use when crafting,
the item you are crafting itself may have some base properties making up the
total attribute impact.
</p>

<p>
Weaponry, jewellery, and armour is made from wood, bone, scale, glass, and
minerals, while clothing items are made from cloths and furs - with a few
overlaps such as boots.
</p>

<p>
Note that at this time the precise number of stat pluses given by each material
is unknown, as it is not equivalent to the number of arrows a piece of equipment
has.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(stat)&gt; gives +1</li>
<li>(stat)&gt;&gt; gives +2 or +3</li>
<li>(stat)&gt;&gt;&gt; gives +4, +5, or +6</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each additional nth arrow gives an additional n possible boosts (4 arrows giving
between +7 and +10, etc.)

You can figure these out by your self, don't sweat them. If there's trouble you
had to run from, kids or monsters or items and belongings you can't find, drop
the damn quest without penalty and get a new batch from the elder, the always
needy people of the realm and/or those workers you brought into your settlement.
</p>

<p>
Here are some really dumb observations about quests:
</p>

<p>
There are more types tied to specific locations. I need to add more info here.

<h3 id="org11f300b"><span class="section-number-3">7.1</span> Suicide Quests</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-1">
<p>
(excerpt from a letter by future pug.)
</p>

<p>
When you get to a new settlement a cheeky elder there is likely to invite you,
the stranger, to suicide by quest.
</p>

<p>
Accept then drop any kill-a-champion and other suspicious sounding quests after
visiting their locations without entering. Turn their game against them by going
there to scout for landmarks of interrest in the general area. Enter a few
random tiles nearby to look for 'who knows what' that spawned there!
</p>

<p>
Wait with the scary quests until you have legendary stats and artisan equipment,
or something close to that. Or wait until you are already thriving at a place
even further from Relica than where you first got the suicide invitations.
</p>

<p>
If you rush yourself, <a href="#orgaca565f">you'll die</a>. Farawella!

<h3 id="orgf63bb26"><span class="section-number-3">7.2</span> Missing Kid Quests</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-2">
<p>
(from the notes of earlier pug.)
</p>

<p>
Stupid Kids! First you can never find them, then you do find one, and when you
bring them home in the middle of the night they want to play hide and seek and
you have to find them in 15 minutes or so. Totally Bogus! aaaargh.
</p>

<p>
Yet again you need to build a shelter. And you need search. At least without
either I've not found a single kid yet. Then you need to rest until morning so
you don't need to make light to find them again whence back in town and they
start playing their games. For that you need to have <a href="#orgc8d51f4">local waypoints</a> by which to
move yourself through the settlement without going nuts. Do you have those?
</p>

<p>
And then you learn about how to make Burlap Dolls. Or perhaps they have that
very last exclusive item elite tier BP you had forgotten you wanted. I might
never learn what they are about cause I can't find the buggers!
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I find tracks leading to unknown dens instead of children. Are these
really just another type of innvitation to suicide myself?  Do i really need to
press "s" so that I <b>/search</b> every square inch of the site? Or should I stop
being of attracting attention and just run around the location and <b>/shout come
here</b>? Probably.

<h3 id="org94e75af"><span class="section-number-3">7.3</span> Desperate Times</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-3">
<p>
You know that times are desperate when almost overyone, no, make that everyone
you meet that's not out to kill you offers you ancestral heirlooms as rewards
for things you've never seen.
</p>

<p>
Needy as they are, they want foods that noone in their right mind would care to
eat, Weapons and other items you have never heard of. And they send you to
<a href="#org7ff0d94">unknown places</a> too. Always they have needs in places you've never been, make you
deliver the weirdest trinkets or their odd selves to hard to find people
and places. The heirlooms from their illustrious ancestors, those medals,
just like their inane request never seem to run out.
</p>

<p>
Well, ok, some of the folks that you ferry between places are actually
interesting to talk to and would appear new to the game and a bit naive as
they just give you unique and valuable items that you can actually use.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you stumbled upon some underground railroad where people of different
factions are relocating all over the map because they are planning something.
</p>

<p>
(at this point pug starts dancing to cheer himself up.)
</p>

<p>
Ok, at least sometimes they had no idea they were paying waay too much for your
services.

I might have missed an item there, but suddenly he asked for a crafted input,
turning <b>bone nunchucks &gt; swordchucks</b>.
</p>

<p>
After he wanted the nunchucks he started asking for wooden blocks. Perhaps we're
coming close to a new materials tier after 12..13 runs.. Verry nice, very
grindy, very medal-expensive!
</p>

<p>
<b>3 wooden blocks &gt; wooden anvil</b>
</p>

<p>
Afterwards he wanted bones again..
</p>

<p>
Anyway, now i can consult the <a href="#org42c15be">Materials Tables</a> and better versions
of his more sensible items. neat!

<p>
The Burning House can be a real oh-sh*t experience. It could be on any tile that
you stumble on pyromanic imps that shoot you with magma right when you land. I
didn't find any until I had complete all the buildings in Relica and it may be
ok to save your paranoia until then.
</p>

<p>
Extrapolating from my random encouter I suspect the imps were not really
malicious, simply driven to madness by the music made by the guy living in the
woods. I mean, why would he live there with his huge piano if people had
appreciated his music?
</p>

<p>
I wish I had not forgotten to <b>/grab</b> and drag the unconscious SOB off the edge

(old info)
</p>

<p>
These travelers seem to have a traitor between them.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Talk to them to figure out who it is!</li>
</ul>

<p>
As you traverse the world of FARA you might come upon caravans along your way. A
caravan consist of 5 travellers and talking to any of them you'll find out that
they have recently been attacked. They suspect one of their own, and this gives
you the chance to play detective.
</p>

<p>
Each person will list how long they've been with the group, their personal
reason for travelling, as well as a good and bad thing to do at their
destination. These are the clues to identify the odd one out.
</p>

<p>
As a reward for solving the mystery you gain the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1x big chest,</li>
<li>1x artisan tool kit,</li>
<li>2x randomized tools,</li>
<li>1x iron shiv,</li>
<li>1x lockpick</li>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org87053c2"></a>Tips for solving the mystery<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-8-2-2-1">
<p>
Typically the activities mentioned fall into the following categories [study],
[trade], [relaxing], [family], and [entertainment]. You will need to talk to all
the travellers and figure out which one they report as the absolute worst to do
at the destination. If two activities are tied, one of them is unlikely to be
used as an alibi by anyone. Confronting and accusing the traveller who says
they're going there for this purpose will unlock a fight. The culprit will turn
hostile and try to kill you. Two ambushers will show up and assault the culprit
first, and you second. After winning the fight you can peacefully collect the
rewards.
</p>

<p>
At the type of writing, it is unclear if telling on the culprit will just fail
the event.
</p>

<p>
Once the event is over all travellers that have not been accused (you could
accuse the wrong one and fail the event) will offer a quest, similar to
commoners in towns.

Awakening as from a dream, he recalls the moment his memories began. There he

<li>Fishmonger's really grindy if you want to do it</li>
<li>Get a whole lot of dowels</li>

<li>Get a crystal/iron/bronze fishing rod</li>
<li>Any uncommon tier fishing rod</li>

<li>wow</li>
<li>And your uncommon fishing rod</li>
<li>Preferably iron, since it's easiest</li>
<li>(find a fortress and salvage the doors)</li>
<li>(You need to craft a wooden fishing rod to unlock other recipes)</li>
<li>Now, go back to spawn with the lake</li>
<li>And fish until the rod's ruined</li>
<li>With the Fishmonger trait, you should have enough runes to salvage into runic shards and make a repair kit with your dowels + shards</li>
<li>Use the repair kit to repair the rod</li>
<li>Repeat that process</li>
<li>passing down anchient knowlage</li>
<li>You should slowly get enough extra runic shards to craft refined tools (25 shards)</li>
<li>Use them on the fishing rod</li>
<li>Continue fishing until the rod is [ruined] and repairing the rod by salvaging the runes</li>
<li>Make it artisan (50 shards)</li>
<li>Then start making your other equipment refined</li>
<li>And then artisan</li>
<li>secret knowlage here wow</li>
<li>You should also get a whole bunch of runes that are useful for you</li>
<li>Get a rune of curses and a rune of intoxication</li>
<li>And set them aside when you get them</li>
<li>Once you've got both, drop them in the same place and use /makespell or /ms</li>
<li>You will now have an arcane curse of intoxication</li>
<li>Fishmonger takes significantly reduced damage while intoxicated, so you can /selfcast 3 to give yourself an arcane curse of intoxication</li>
<li>The reason the element chosen is arcane is because very few entities use the arcane element</li>
<li>And curse spells increase damage taken from an element</li>
<li>The intoxication rune has to be on an attacking spell, since it's a negative effect</li>
<li>Basically You curse yourself with intoxication + increased arcane damage taken</li>
<li>i knew thats an exploit. i just thought i could use some vodka or smth :slight<sub>smile</sub>:</li>
<li>But nothing really uses the arcane element so you only really get intoxication</li>
<li>Yes, you can use vodka and all other alcohol</li>
<li>so in summery fish fish fish curse fish fish fish and get POWA</li>
<li>Fishmonger has 2 spell slots, so you can make a second spell too</li>
<li>the intox debuff gives you +RES and +CHA</li>

Botanist is one of the interesting classes you can use in Fara, their unique
ability "Familiar Phytology" has a huge potential if you know how to use it
efficiently. First of all let's see what the ability is about.
</p>

<p>
Familiar Phytology - Botanists have access to the Enrich Plant skill, which
allows them to turn any plant into allied Plant baby. Feeding Plant Babies by
hand will cause them to grow more powerful, and the chosen food will determine
what abilities/skills they have. Casting Enrich Plant while already having a
plant familiar will kill the older familiar.
</p>

<p>
Basically after using the "Enrich Plant" skill of the botanist on trees or
bushes will turn them into an ally plant baby. An allied plan has a total of 4
stages.
</p>

<p>
Plant baby
Plant kid
Plant beast
Plant behemoth
</p>

<p>
As you may have read earlier plant allies can be evolved by being hand fed
anything that is edible. You will need a total of 55 food to max out the
evolution process of your plant, but always remember to think about on what the
55th food will be since that will determine what type of behemoth you will get!
Other than being being able to get them from your first day in your run, you can
make new ones that will be stronger the farther you are from Relica! So far I
have only tapped into Veteran behemoths but I think there are far more stronger
variants the farther we go, for now I will show the stats of an amateur ones
below.
</p>

<p>
Number of how many you have to feed before evolving along with stats and skills
Plant baby	5
Str-average
Fin-average
Res-average
Ins-average
Cha-average
No skills available
</p>


<p>
Plant kid	15
Str-above average
Fin-above average
Res-above average
Ins-above average
Cha-above average
No skills available
</p>


<p>
Plant beast	35
Str-good
Fin-good
Res-good
Ins-good
Cha-good
Thorn volley
</p>

<p>
Plant Behemoth	max	Will depend on what kind of behemoth you make
Will also depend on what kind you make
</p>

<p>
This may help you in the early run if you can get them into a behemoth fast
since you may also get a mercenary as another companion with your first battle
chest reward when you get to Relica. The stats will go up as you make plant
allies when you are farther Relica, and also another good thing is it will not
cost you anything other than some few seeds and berries here and there.
</p>

<p>
I am not finished with this blog yet since I myself have not seen everything the
behemoths have to offer! Sorry if I have some grammatical errors and other
things since English is not my mother tongue. I'm sure there are other people
who knows more than me so if you guys have some spare time you can add your own
knowledge here, I only saw 3 behemoths so far so I cannot post everything for
behemoths yet

<p>
The Rhapsodist is a class in FARA with a very unique play style.
 Whenever the Rhapsodist attacks, it plays a note.
 The note is dependent if the attack is a normal or a Heavy.
 When you sing four notes, it makes a song.
 Different songs have different effects.
 The order of the notes in the song does matter, unless it's the Cleansing song.
 The two notes are short (normal attack) and long (heavy attack).
 All buffs applied to allies with songs are also applied to yourself.
</p>

<p>
Note 1	Note 2	Note 3	Note 4	Song Name	Effect
See below*				Song of Cleansing|	removing negative effects from nearby allies
Long	Long	Long	Long	Song of Destruction|	boosting attack power of nearby allies
Short	Long	Short	Short	Song of Shadows|	enter in stealth
Short	Short	Long	Short	Song of Diligence|	reducing the stamina used by nearby allies
Long	Long	Long	Short	Song of Sadness|	decreasing the mood of nearby enemies
Long	Long	Short	Long	Song of Bliss|	increasing the mood of nearby allies
Short	Long	Long	Long	Song of Wastrels|	draining stamina of nearby enemies
Short	Short	Short	Long	Song of Protection|	reduce damage taken by allies
Short	Short	Short	Short	Song of Lasting|	increase duration of nearby effect
Long	Short	Long	Long	Song of Light|	illuminating nearby enemies
The attacks don't have to be consecutive, and only the last one has to hit a target for the song to start.
</p>

<p>
For example: you can hit the air three times, travel to another tile, wait for a full day and even rest and you will complete the song on your next valid attack (as of 0.0.15.18b)
</p>


<p>
<b>There's seven different ways of performing a Song of Cleansing</b>:
 2S and 2L (in any order) and L - S - S - S

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-10-1-2">
<p>
Get the quest to go to Relica and go, then immediately abandon any kill
quests. Inspect then salvage every wooden object in Relica except the closest
door to the elder. Take the glass mug. That house will be your home base. /craft
workbench and drop it and all of your wooden blocks and hero medals in a corner
of your house.
</p>

<p>
Fill up your glass mug, sleep in your house (remember to close the door,) then
do easy quests and waypoint anything you come across while traveling to look at
monsters or find children. Also, salvage any equipment and runes you don’t care
about and put the resources on your workbench pile. Repeat this until you find
at least 2 fortresses.
</p>

<p>
When you come across a <b>Will of the Wild Fortress</b>, interact with the officer and
give them at least 10 medals. Interact with the Tactician and take the first 2
minor traits on the list.
</p>

<p>
Salvage all iron doors in every fortress you know of and hoard them on top of
your workbench. Continue doing easy quests until you have some copper or better
equipment, including a tower shield, and enough medals to make the total medals
given to Will of the Wild 100.
</p>

<p>
Go to the WotW Fortress with your medals and give them medals so you have max
rep with them in the /factions screen. This should take 100 total medals,
including the initial few you gave, though it will take more if you killed any
WotW staff.
</p>

<p>
Once you do that, take Analyzer (replacing the trait other than Plunderer) and
inspect all your copper (or better) equipment. You can now make iron versions of
that equipment. Do so.
</p>

<p>
How many runic shards do you have right now? Is it less than 266? /craft
dowel. /craft wooden shovel. /craft wooden repair kit. Find a beach. Dig (/dig)
once on each tile, picking up every rune that spawns. With a wooden shovel, you
can dig 16 times before you need to use your repair kit to fix your shovel. This
number will be lower if you use a non-wooden repair kit to repair the shovel.
</p>

<p>
If your shovel is orange, don’t dig again. If your wooden repair kit is broken,
find a pile of clay and /craft clay repair kit. A clay repair kit will give you
less digs per use, but is easy to produce.
</p>

<p>
Repeat this until you have enough runes to salvage to get you to 266 runic
shards, plus an additional Rune of Rejuvenation and Rune of Shields. Drop all
the other runes in your inventory and use the salvage all command (usually the 7
key, but may be a different key if you’re targeting something) until all the
runes are shards. Take those shards back home to your huge pile of stuff.
</p>

<p>
Make a Shield of Rejuvenation of a dual element of your choice (I recommend at
least using water in the shield, however) by dropping the Rune of Shields, the
Rune of Rejuvenation, and 2 elemental runes of your choice (and no other runes)
on the same tile, then doing /makespell. Learn this spell.
</p>

<p>
Go to the WotW Fortress and take the Fabricator trait, replacing Analyzer. Go
back home and craft 7 Reinforced Tools and 7 Artisan tools. Use the Reinforced
tools on your equipment, then go to the WotW Fortress once more and take the
Forgemaster trait.
</p>

<p>
Use your Artisan Tools on your equipment. Put water runes on three of your
equipment and 2 of everything else on your equipment, excluding your weapon. You
only put water on your weapon because it's healing every heavy attack. Putting
any extra runes on the weapon would cause the healing to be every other heavy
attack, effectively halving your healing.
</p>

<p>
Finally, craft enough Sturdy Plates to get you to Godlike RES and slap those on
pieces of your equipment that aren’t your weapon. Your weapon should have an
Arcane Sigil, which must be found (Tool Chests are useful for this.) The
remaining slots are your choice. FIN is useful for stealth, INS for lowering
your Ward’s cost, STR for getting it to godlike, and CHA for increasing your
Ward’s and Rejuvenation’s duration.
</p>

<p>
Congratulations, you’re pretty close to immortal. Remember to use your Ward of
Rejuvenation before starting a fight, rather than after, and to heavy attack
twice when you’re able in order to heal. If you’re low on health, enter a safe
location, use your Ward of Rejuvenation, and walk around until the rejuvenation
wears off, then cast it again. Repeat until full health.
</p>

<p>
The only things that can realistically threaten you are your own stupidity,
Ruins if you aren’t careful, and potentially some spoiler monster. Though, this
assumes you don’t walk too far from Relica. I haven’t seen what kind of damage
output exists thousands of km away from Relica.
</p>

<p>
So, go crazy (except around Ruins. Be careful there.) Kill whatever. You’ll get
significantly more points if you get key fragments, so go get them. Castles are
easy sources, since you can just kill all the guards in the noble’s room, then
kill the noble for a fragment, then stealth away.
</p>

<p>
Be sure to use any Obelisk Shards you get to upgrade your Shield of Rejuvenation
to Flawless.
</p>

<p>
Once you get the key, start eating fragments with /cast conversion. Only eat one
at a time, and only after you get your 10th fragment. This maximizes points per
fragment by making you get key completion points every time you get a
fragment. Using conversions on godlike stats is wasteful, but otherwise, use
them on whatever you want. It’s just a matter of time until you have 100k+
points.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-1-5">
<p>
Well met, travelers!
Public Alpha 16 is here, and with it come some HUGE changes to the core mechanics of FARA. Combat and dying have been overhauled, and many other facets have been adjusted with the goals of encouraging exploration and smoothing game progression. I want to give a special thanks to the volunteers in our awesome Discord community for testing these changes over the last month. FARA is so much better because of your thoughtful feedback and gigantic brains. The notes presented below are but a fraction of what this update has to offer. FARA is a game about exploration after all, so I encourage you to start a new adventure and discover all the new goodies for yourself!
</p>
</div>



<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org6dcf242"></a>BLIGHTS:<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-1-5-1">
<p>
This update adds a little more flair to the concept of permadeath with the introduction of the Blight mechanic. Instead of immediately perishing when dealt a killing blow, you now have the option to be resurrected with a permanent difficulty modifier. These modifiers, or blights, range from stat reductions to increased encounter rate. You have the option to accept a blight every time you die, but the chances of successfully resurrecting are lowered based on the number of blights you have.
</p>

<p>
As FARA grows in scope and presents new long-term progression options for players, the idea of permadeath as it existed seemed harsh and out of place. With the blight system, players should feel more empowered to explore and grow with the same character without the threat of their first mistake completely wiping out all of the time and resources they've invested in their worlds.
</p>
</div>
</li>



<li><a id="orga74ee1b"></a>COMBAT:<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-1-5-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Variable speeds for most combat actions have been removed, making combat feel more turn-based. For every action you perform, all other combatants will also perform a single action.</li>

<li>Added a /dash action. Dashing allows entities to move across multiple tiles in a single moment at the cost of stamina. Max dash distance is determined, among other factors, by Finesse. Dashing can also be performed by holding Shift and using the arrow keys. Releasing the Shift key will perform the dash.</li>

<li>Added ~10 new unique heavy attack effects, including unique effects for Insight-based weapons</li>

<li>Swapping two held items is now a free action which does not use a turn.</li>

<li>Weapon size no longer plays a role in damage output or speed.</li>

<li>Heavy attack stamina usage is now determined by the wielder's proficiency in the weapon's 'needed' stat.</li>

<li>Reduced the duration of most effects, buffs, and debuffs by ~75%. Because of the changes to action speed, effects still expire at roughly the same point in a combat encounter.</li>

<li>Most common damage-over-time effects now tick every moment instead of every ~5. Because of the duration reductions, they still deal about the same amount of total damage.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>



<li><a id="org38d69e5"></a>EXPLORATION &amp; CRAFTING:<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-1-5-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added some new items and NPCs in settlements to aid in resource management and exchanges</li>

<li>Removed hunger and thirst</li>

<li>Increased the likelihood of finding items and NPCs of interest when exploring local areas</li>

<li>Reduced encounter chance when moving on the world map</li>

<li>Common enemies now have a chance to drop crafting resources</li>

<li>Increased starting inventory size from 20 to 25</li>

<li>Increased Hidden Pocket inventory bonus from 2 to 5</li>

<li>Simplified the crafting requirements of many weapons and tools</li>

<li>Increased the material cost Workbenches and gave them the ability to repair all personal items at once</li>

<li>Removed a big chunk of the starting recipes and dramatically increased the likelihood of finding items/recipes you don't have</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>



<li><a id="org16f21d8"></a>CLASS CHANGES:<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-1-5-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Illusionist: Removed Blink spell and replaced it with Prestige, an ability which allows the caster and target to switch places</li>

<li>Juggernaut: Their /dash causes damage to encountered obstacles</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>



<li><a id="orgafbd639"></a>NEW LAYOUT OPTIONS:<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-1-5-5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added 2 new interface layout options which can be enabled with /layout2 (also known as /bigmap) and /layout3. They can be particularly helpful for those who wish the minimap was larger:</li>
</ul>

<p>
Layout 1 (default):
Layout2:
Layout 3:
</p>
</div>
</li>


<li><a id="orga3910b5"></a>MISCELLANEOUS:<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-1-5-6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Made some substantial engine optimizations. The game should run much, much better in crowded environments.</li>

<li>Mouseover tooltips can now be disabled with /tooltips.</li>

<li>Arcane Obelisks in settlements now have infinite uses.</li>

<li>Autoloot is now enabled by default. If you've played FARA before, you might need to manually turn this setting on with /autoloot, or via the /settings menu.</li>

<li>FINALLY updated some of the outdated information under /help and /define</li>

<li>Fixed a crash caused by butchering fish</li>

<li>Fixed an issue with blight spells (now called plagues) lasting forever</li>

<li>Fixed a crash caused by /define</li>

<li>Fixed all sorts of typos</li>

<li>Added new typos</li>
</ul>



<p>
As is the case with every update regardless of size, starting up a new adventure is strongly recommended over trying to load an older save. In this case, trying to load anything older than 0.0.16 won't even work.
</p>

<p>
Good luck out there, travelers!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Removed several unfinished settlement facilities. They will make a return when they actually do something. For now, every settlement has the same 5 facilities, and they are always in the same style of building.</li>
<li>Finished the Warehouse facility</li>
<li>Added a /recipe 'itemname' command which lists the components of a specified known recipe. Can also be performed with /rcp.</li>
<li>Added a /deletetitle command for permanently removing earned titles from the /factions window</li>
<li>Added 'Repair' as a mouse menu option when possible</li>
<li>Updated castle Nobles to fall more in line with the quest behavior of settlement Elders. One notable difference is that the completion or failure of noble quests will affect faction reputation. For now, the quest types are the same ones you know and love, with the goal of having faction-specific quest types in the future.</li>
<li>Inspecting bags now unlocks recipes for the next size/type of bag.</li>
<li>The /repair command can now utilize Repair Kits on the ground as long as they're within reach.</li>
<li>Made unknown landmarks more obvious when traversing the world map</li>
<li>If you've been having input issues and have a game controller connected to your computer, you may now use /ignorecontrollers to (hopefully) fix any problems.</li>
<li>Typing '/inspect all' will now inspect all items on your target list. Each inspection still counts as a complete action, and the sequence will be interrupted if you take damage.</li>
<li>Updated the criteria for which character deaths/retirements are announced on Discord</li>
<li>The character sheet now properly shows attunements after death</li>
<li>Fixed a long-standing issue with NPCs taking 1 more moment than the player to perform any action. The fix for the this was suspiciously easy, so I'm positive I've broken something. Let me know what you find!</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented Traders from working as intended</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the /autosave setting from persisting after reload. Note, this is different from the forced saves that take place after certain game events. Forced saves cannot be disabled.</li>
<li>Fixed several instances of jank looking fireworks when /bigmap is enabled</li>
<li>Fixed several instances of map cursors lingering longer than they should</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which prevented the manifestation of a second minor trait if you had a major trait</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with cavern entities such as chests and nodes crowding the cavern entrance instead of being spread throughout the cavern.</li>
<li>Fixed a game crash caused by the Giant Swing ability</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with certain entities not showing up on the target list at the proper distances</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-2-31">
<p>
Long time no see, travelers!
</p>

<p>
It's been 568 days since FARA's last public update, but that isn't to say the project has been dormant. A dedicated, intrepid group of adventurers has been testing a rebuilt version of the game since July, and that test-of-a-test is now ready for everyone to&#x2026; test. There have been well over 120 patches in that time, and what's listed below is a summary of the highlights. If by chance you want to read every raw, potentially spoilery, nitty gritty detail without much context, you can find the full 1,300+ line changelog here: <a href="http://playfara.com/2020changelog.txt">http://playfara.com/2020changelog.txt</a>. I want to give my most heartfelt thanks to everyone invited to test the changes over the last few months. You could have spent that time and energy on anything, and the fact you chose to help make FARA a better game means the world to me.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="orgb6f0172"></a>SUMMARY:<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-2-31-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The biggest goal of this update was to re-write many of FARA's underlying systems and data structures. In doing so, the game should run faster and scale better with future development. There are also a TON of bug fixes, gameplay changes, and usability improvements. If you've tried FARA in the past and spent more time fighting the interface than monsters, I encourage you to give this new build a shot.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org2649da7"></a>INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS:<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-2-31-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can now hold down the arrow keys to continuously move in a direction. Additionally, you can click and drag from the center of the screen to activate a virtual joystick and move around.</li>

<li>There is now an interact button in the target window which can either be clicked to perform the displayed action, or at least inform you of what action pressing [ Enter ] will perform.</li>

<li>Right-clicking in the center of the screen now presents the same target options as clicking on the target window. Holding the right mouse button down while scrolling the mouse wheel will cycle through targets.</li>

<li>Hovering the mouse over objects on the map will display what they are, and clicking an object will target it and bring up a list of options.</li>

<li>Added more bump-to-interact options. Bumping into foliage will harvest it, bumping into large ore nodes will attempt to mine them, bumping into non-hostile NPCs will /interact with them.</li>

<li>Added drag and drop! Dragging objects from the Nearby Targets window and dropping them on your inventory or the game log will attempt to /take them. Dragging items in your possession and releasing them on the game log will /drop them. Dragging items in your possession and releasing them on your target will attempt to /give the item. You can also drag items between your holding, wearing, and inventory windows.</li>

<li>Added tooltips! You can now hover your cursor over most objects and targets to learn about them.</li>

<li>Added animations! Several (mostly combat-related) actions now have animated effects which will play over the target window or the center of the screen.</li>

<li>Added a new interface for building structures. Press [ b ] or type /build with Wooden Blocks near by to create buildings one room at a time instead of tile by tile.</li>

<li>The health and stamina bars are now displayed by default.</li>

<li>All of the most frequently used pop-up windows (/character, /spells, /recipes, etc) now have tabs along the top, allowing quick access to the other frequently viewed windows. Continuously pressing [ c ] will cycle through all of the windows.</li>

<li>Clicking on party members now displays options to view their stats, items, and spells.</li>

<li>Pressing [ - ] now opens a window which shows the entire local map. If you are in a dungeon or somewhere similar, this map will only show areas you have seen. This feature can also be accessed by clicking the header of the minimap or typing /map.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org209bfb3"></a>GAMEPLAY CHANGES:<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-2-31-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There is now a static settlement named Relica near the start of an adventure. The further you travel from Relica, the more difficult (and rewarding) the game becomes. There are still randomly generated settlements, but they are few and far between.</li>

<li>Added fast travel, accessed by either clicking a waypoint or typing /travel (waypoint number). If you are tracking a waypoint, you can also click on the compass.</li>

<li>Most randomness has been removed from combat. There are no longer chances to miss or crit - both will happen consistently when the right conditions are met. Elemental weapons will always trigger their effects with heavy attacks and never on regular attacks. Elemental spells will always trigger their effects with every cast.</li>

<li>Jumping while targeted by an attack will cause you to dodge the attack. In the case of a spell, you will take half the spell's normal damage and avoid any secondary effects.</li>

<li>Ranged weapon attacks now has a reload penalty which adds time to your next action</li>

<li>Stamina now regenerates over time, and is more of a per-encounter resource than a per-rest resource. Heavy attacks and jumping/dodging use considerably more stamina than before.</li>

<li>The gap between the lowest and highest health classes has been narrowed. Classes now either have slightly below average health, average, or slightly about average health.</li>

<li>Most of the primary stats have been renamed, and their purposes tweaked:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Strength: Increases damage dealt with melee weapons and unarmed strikes, decreases stamina spent pushing large objects</li>
<li>Finesse: Increases damage dealt with ranged weapons, increases chance to disarm traps, increases stealth ability, decreases reload time of ranged weapons, decreases stamina use of jumping and stealth</li>
<li>Resilience: Reduces physical damage taken, reduces duration of negative effects, increases stamina regeneration rate</li>
<li>Insight: Increases damage of spells, increases search ability, decreases stamina cost of spells</li>
<li>Charm: Increases the duration of positive effects, increases odds of favorable outcomes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wisdom has been removed</li>

<li>Added equipment slots - Head, Body, Hands, Feet, and Accessory. Typical equipment will fit into one of the slots. The accessory slot retains the old behavior of allowing anything* to be equipped there.</li>

<li>Added a trait system. Traits add passive bonuses and features to your character. There are 3 types - Master, Major, and Minor. Master traits are determined by your class and cannot be changed. Major and Minor traits can be acquired from different factions as rewards for helping them. You can have 1 Major trait and 2 Minor traits.</li>

<li>Added several new enemies, encounter types and scenarios</li>

<li>Dungeons have been reworked to produce more interesting layouts, and new kinds of obstacles have been added</li>

<li>Randomly generated factions have been removed in favor of 3 static factions - the Radiant Hand, the Jade Circle, and the Wild of the Wild. There is a lot in store for the faction system, but for now, they serve as the primary means of acquiring traits.</li>

<li>World biome distribution is far more logical and aesthetically pleasing than before.</li>

<li>Meals are now stackable, provide rejuvenation, and only use a single ingredient. Cooking multiple items on a fire will produce multiple meals.</li>

<li>Crafting materials have been rebalanced across the board. A handful have been removed, and several new ones have been added.</li>

<li>You can no longer craft unknown objects for twice the material cost. Instead, inspecting an item will teach several related recipes.</li>

<li>The default maximum party size has been reduced from 4 to 2.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org9b3b789"></a>CLASS CHANGES:<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-2-31-4">
<p>
Blacksmith, Brewmaster, Tailor, Spelunker, Constable, Astronomer, and Yogi have been removed. Their abilities and features have been added to other classes.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added Mortician! Ability: Undertaking: Morticians have access to the Fervent Embalming spell which raises corpses to fight for a short duration. Additionally, Morticians do not attract hostile targets when resting outdoors, and gain a bonus to all stats and vision at night.</li>

<li>Added Peasant! Peasants have terrible stats across the board and can't use magic. If you wanted FARA to be more challenging, here's your Expert Mode.</li>

<li>Spellthief: They now have an active ability to learn the last ability to affect them instead of automatically learning everything</li>

<li>Adventurer has been reworked: "Adventurers have an increased chance to find rare items. They also have the Heroic Feat ability which provides a temporary boost to all stats once per rest."</li>

<li>Pit Fighter has been reworked: "Pit Fighters have heightened stamina regeneration when bleeding, dazed, or immobilized. They also have the Payback ability which deals damage to a target in melee range equal to twice the most recent damage received and causes bleeding."</li>

<li>Duelist has been reworked: "Duelists gain Opportunity after perfectly timed dodges, allowing their next action to be performed without using stamina. They also have the En Garde ability which increases the Duelist's damage against a selected target while amplifying damage the Duelists receives from other sources."</li>

<li>Executioner has been reworked: "Executioner's killing blows deal splash damage and knock adjacent targets to the ground. They also have the Last Word ability which deals heavy damage to targets who are Dying."</li>

<li>Juggernaut has been reworked: "Juggernauts are immune to immobilization and force spells, deal twice as much damage to non-sentient objects, knock down hostile targets after jumping, and can smash through most doors."</li>

<li>Gatekeeper has been reworked: "Gatekeepers will deflect long-range projectiles, and their shields and armor take less damage in combat. They also have the Protect ability which temporarily reduces the amount of damage a target takes by half."</li>

<li>Soldier has been reworked: "Soldiers gain increased damage resistance as their health decreases."</li>

<li>Kung Fu Master has been reworked: "Standard attacks trigger Bear Stance, causing thier next heavy attack to inflict Dazing. Heavy attacks trigger Monkey Stance, causing thier next jump to grant Quickness. Jumping triggers Tiger Stance, causing their next standard attack to inflict bleeding."</li>

<li>Fishmonger has been reworked: "Fishmongers cannot drown, take greatly reduced damage while Intoxicated and are immune to the negative effects, and have a higher chance to catch rare items while fishing."</li>

<li>Elemancer has been reworked: "Elemancers have a bonus to all elemental attunements. They also have the Attune ability which channels the elemental energy of a target to boost the caster's relative attunement. Successfully casting the ability a second time will combine the elements, providing two boosts at half the potency. Attunements are lost after rest."</li>

<li>Scholar has been reworked: "Scholars gain Enlightenment after conversing with someone or learning a new recipe, temporarily increasing their insight. Scholars can cast spells from scrolls at higher tiers based on their insight, and can use the same scroll several times."</li>

<li>Gamber has been reworked: "Gamblers have access to the 'Gamble' ability which inflicts a random negative condition to either the caster or their target. Charm reduces the stamina cost of this ability and increases the likelihood of afflicting the target over the caster. When used on certain chests, Gamble will either upgrade the quality of the chest or completely destroy it."</li>

<li>Ragamuffin has been reworked: "Ragamuffins have an increased chance to steal successfully, and can find a wider variety of items. In combat, Ragamuffins can attempt to /steal weapons used to attack them."</li>

<li>Kunoichi has been reworked: "When attacking from stealth, Kunoichi deal bonus damage and remain hidden if the attack kills their target. Additionally, Kunoichi recover from the Revealed effect twice as quickly, and gain Quickness when Revealed."</li>

<li>Gamestalker has been reworked: "Gamestalkers immobilize targets when attacking from stealth at range."</li>

<li>Demon Slayer has been reworked: "Demon Slayers take reduced damage from legendary monsters and spells, and silence enemies with their heavy attacks."</li>

<li>Wrestler has been reworked: "Wrestlers can use the Giant Swing ability, allowing them to throw a target to an area of their choosing, causing them to take damage, land prone, and become Dazed. Additionally, Wrestlers are immune to being dazed, and do not receive any penalties while prone."</li>

<li>Bodybuilders have been reworked: "Bodybuilders have access to the Flex ability which will blind a hostile target. If completely unarmored, Flex will also provide a temporary Charm bonus and cleanse negative status effects."</li>

<li>Kensai has been tweaked: In addition to their Samurai Showdown ability, they now instantly counter-attack after performing a perfect dodge.</li>

<li>Illusionist has been reworked: "Illusionists will immediately enter stealth for a short duration when damaged by a critical hit. Additionally, Illusionists detect illusions and disguises without fail."</li>

<li>Rift Dancer has been reworked: "A Rift Dancer's heavy attacks and spells summon creatures from other planes."</li>
</ul>

<p>
Saying there is more to the update than what is listed above would be the understatement of a lifetime. While I could have gone into greater detail, let's not forget that FARA is a game about exploration and discovery. Adventure awaits!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-4-2">
<p>
The first public alpha for FARA was released one year ago today! I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who's taken the time to try FARA out and provide feedback. This game wouldn't be even half of what it is today were it not for the enthusiastic, welcoming, and dedicated community which has built up over the last year. I've wanted to be a game dev since I was a kid, and the FARA community has made that dream more fulfilling than I ever thought possible. You all have been incredible, and I look forward to the continued discourse that has shaped the game into something so many people find enjoyable. Now, let's celebrate the occasion by making the game way harder:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Key Fragments no longer resurrect the player when killed.</li>
<li>Added a new innate spell to the player character - Astral Blessing. This ability expends ALL collected Key Fragments to completely restore health, stamina, and mood. Astral Blessing also bestows several positive effects for a moderate duration, removes all hunger and thirst, and damages nearby enemies.</li>
<li>Started working on some public leaderboard stuff. When a character of notable achievement dies, retires, slays a dungeon boss, or completes the Astral Key, an announcement will be made in the FARA Discord (<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn">https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn</a>). You can set a username ingame with /setusername yourname. You can opt out of this feature with /eventsharing.</li>
<li>Increased the importance of dexterity for reliably hitting targets with ranged weapons</li>
<li>Removed the strength bonus from ranged weapon damage</li>
<li>Made some changes to the start of the game</li>
<li>Removed wooden planks from the game and adjusted crafting recipes for objects which used them</li>
<li>Individual keybindings can now be reset with '/setkey keytochange default'</li>
<li>Made an adjustment which should make it a little easier to build shelters when you have allies following you</li>
<li>Typing /define without specifying any text wil now show all glossary entries.</li>
<li>Non-sentient entities can no longer be knocked prone.</li>
<li>Fixed several broken commands issued via mouse menu</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which prevented the [ z ] key from being re-bound</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which allowed certain monster abilities to work on slain entities</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that allowed traps be salvaged with /salvageall.</li>
<li>Fixed (more) issues with the Pounce ability</li>
<li>Fixed an edge case with Elder riddles which allowed duplicates of certain answers</li>
<li>Fixed a crash caused by entering castles</li>
</ul>

<p>
A fresh game is required in order to continue regular play.

<h4 id="orgd8a2520"><span class="section-number-4">11.4.8</span> 2019.05.11 Patch Notes</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-4-8">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added a new class, the Bloodweaver! Unique Ability: Hemophiliancy - Bloodweavers have access to the Blood Pact spell which places a Sigil of Blood on a target. This sigil slowly grows in potency over time, dealing increased damage while increasing the power of the target. Casting Blood Pact on a target affected by Sigil of Blood will transfer the sigil to the caster while retaining its potency level. Casting Blood Pact on target while affected by Sigil of Blood will transfer the existing sigil to the target. Only one Sigil of Blood may be active at a time.</li>
<li>Reworked Beekeeper. Unique Ability: Hiveminded - When Beekeepers interact with beehives, they become swarmed by a mass of bees which they can command using the Send Bees and Call Bees abilities. Beehives of different materials produce different kinds of swarms. Beekeepers have no additional materials cost for building unknown hive types, and are immune to the negative effects of swarms.</li>
<li>Made some adjustments to the Elemancer class:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reduced health to Below Average</li>
<li>The trigger chance for elements on their armor is now based on the quality of the armor</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reduced the size/weight of common fruits and vegetables</li>
<li>Reduced the material cost of shelters</li>
<li>Masterwork items can no longer harness two elements. Artifacts remain the same.</li>
<li>Travelling unstealthed in the overworld no longer uses stamina. Traveling stealthed uses stamina and takes twice as long.</li>
<li>Increased the rate at which hunger and thirst build while travelling the overworld</li>
<li>Reworked animal mounting. Potential mounts must now be tamed with a saddle before they can be ridden. The quality of the saddle as well as several other factors determine the likelihood of successfully taming an animal. Equestrians get a bonus to tame attempts.- Entities now also have a chance to be knocked from their mount when struck.</li>
<li>Entities can no longer trigger elemental effects via self-targeted skills and abilities.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the Quests &amp; Reputation menu option from displaying correctly</li>

<p>
NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 14:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All items and materials have had their stats rebalanced, and 4 new materials have been added. Generally speaking, achieving extremely high stats takes more planning than before, and fights should last a little longer with (slightly) fewer unexpected damage spikes.</li>
<li>The dexterity stat has been completely reworked, and with it comes a few changes to combat:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The dodge chance provided by dexterity now only applies when moving or jumping. This means that in order to be successful with a dexterous character, you actually need to move around as you fight.</li>
<li>Dexterity now reduces the stamina cost of jumping, and the cost of jumping has been slightly increased.</li>
<li>High dexterity is now critical for reliably disarming traps and using stealth</li>
<li>The "enemy blocked your movement even though you weren't going that way" mechanic has been removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Charisma now increases the duration of positive effects in addition to reducing the duration of negative ones.</li>
<li>Intelligence now reduces the cost of most spells instead of Wisdom</li>
<li>Constitution and Wisdom are now more effective at reducing physical and elemental damage respectively.</li>
<li>Added a new item type: Reinforcements. Reinforcements can be added to other items to increase certain stats or grant advantages to certain actions.</li>
<li>Added a message grouping setting which consolidates repeated messages into a single line. It is on by default, and can be toggled with /messagegrouping.</li>
<li>Added speed information to attack messages</li>
<li>Added [ ? ] as a hard-coded shortcut to open /help</li>
<li>Added several new encounter types and revamped the Caravan encounter</li>
<li>Added 2 new weapon types</li>
<li>Revamped the /inventory command to show a detailed list of all your possessions. The default shortcut is [ shift + i ].</li>
<li>Reworked the /accomplishments screen to provide a little more detail about your deeds, and expanded it beyond quest completions. Entries will also be generated for title acquisitions, defeating legendary beasts, etc.</li>
<li>Pigments and Scribe Chests have been removed from the game, and instead areas can be marked freely with the new /mark (color) command. Areas can be cleaned with /clearmark.</li>
<li>Fleshed out the noise system a bit. If something is moving nearby and you can't see it, you might still hear it.</li>
<li>Allies can now be instructed to ride animals</li>
<li>The darkness effect now increases the mood of the attacker in addition to draining the mood of the target</li>
<li>Increased the amount of stamina gained from the Soul effect</li>
<li>Players can now choose their class with the mouse during character creation.</li>
<li>Reduced overworld encounter chance slightly</li>
<li>Reduced the base duration of Elemental summons</li>
<li>Reduced damage taken by armor and added variance based on the type of attack used against it.</li>

<li>Fixed a crash caused by bags</li>

<li>Pit Fighter: When critically hit, Pit Fighters gain the Payback effect, which grants bonus damage to their next attack based on the amount of damage received.</li>

<li>You can now tell party members to be/not be passive. While passive, party members will still defend themselves and their allies, but will not immediately attack anything you attack.</li>

As is usually required when there's a big update**,
a fresh game is required for everything to work properly,
and the game probably won't start at all if you attempt to load an older save.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-5-5">
</div>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org1ce401c"></a>NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 13:<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-5-5-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This alpha release overhauls FARA's oldest, and quite frankly, most confusing system - combat:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Offensive attacks, defensive attacks, evasive attacks, balanced attacks, pushing, kicking, and parries have been removed in favor of just two attacks: Regular attacks ([ a ] or /attack) and Heavy attacks ([ shift + a ] or /attackheavy).</li>
<li>Regular attacks behave mostly like Balanced attacks from pre Alpha 13.</li>
<li>Heavy attacks tend to be slower, more powerful, use stamina, decrease weapon durability, and trigger special effects based on the weapon used. For instance, performing a heavy attack with a dagger or similar small blade will cause the attacker to leap backward evasively after the strike. Other heavy attacks can deflect projectiles, apply status effects, etc.</li>
<li>Entities gain most of the benefits provided by the removed Defensive/Evasive stances as long as they can see the attacker and are not performing any actions (including attacking)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added class-specific combat behaviors for NPCs. Gunslingers will jumping around to dodge ranged attacks, Alchemists will throw mixtures, etc.</li>
<li>Added ~10 new weapon types</li>
<li>Rebalanced the stats for several material and item types</li>
<li>Entities no longer need a target selected to attack. Attacking without a target will now just attack in the direction you are facing.</li>
<li>Made several changes to the stealth mechanic to award those who properly prepare for the occasion</li>
<li>Elemental Resistance has been changed to Elemental Attunement.  In addition to granting resistances, attunement also increases the potency of one's triggered elemental effects</li>
<li>Health and stamina bars now show the last instance of damage in a slightly faded color</li>
<li>Increased inventory capacity from 20 to 25</li>
<li>Reduced the damage of most melee weapons</li>
<li>Combative NPCs will now investigate strange noises they hear from unseen entities</li>
<li>Changed the Intoxicated condition - it now reduces attack accuracy while increasing charisma, constitution, and the chance to stumble after missing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orgef78dc8"></a>CLASS CHANGES:<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-5-5-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Gatekeeper - Reworked their unique ability: "Gatekeepers have a higher than usual chance to deflect projectiles and block moving enemies attempting to flee. Additionally, their shields and armor take less damage when struck."</li>
<li>Elemancer - They now received a bonus to all elemental attunements</li>
<li>Dervish - Whirling now prevents Dervishes from being interrupted by attacks</li>
<li>Rhapsodist - Their songs now require four notes and are a combination of heavy and regular attacks</li>
<li>Monk - Path of Fire now triggers for entities in tiles adjacent to the jump path</li>
<li>Demon Slayer - They now have a chance to resist damage from Legendary Monsters</li>
<li>Potter - Fixed several issues which prevented the class from working as intended</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-6-8-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This alpha release introduces a pretty big game-changer regarding accessibility - FARA can now enjoyed with a mouse or touchscreen! As much as I love writing beefy changelogs, the changes are pretty simple:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Clicking/tapping objects on the side panels will display a tiny* menu with various contextual actions</li>
<li>Clicking anywhere in the central game log or status section will provide access to more general commands and features</li>
<li>Clicking on a map tile will now move your character toward that tile. If you're in a local area, you'll zip right to the targeted location in one click. If you're on the world map, you'll move one tile in the direction of the cursor. Clicking the center tile will search the area.</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-6-8-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rebalanced health values across all classes. If your favorite class went from 'Above Average' to 'Average' health, it doesn't necessarily mean the value is lower than before. Additionally, the classifications of health no longer vary between classes. Two classes with 'Above Average' health now have exactly the same amount.</li>
<li>Pressing the [ enter ] key will now trigger the /interact function with your target if the command prompt is closed.</li>
<li>Dramatically improved the pathfinding capabilities of NPCs.</li>
<li>Added richer descriptions and additional mouse menu options for those interested in playing with the UI disabled</li>
<li>Added /moveto command which pathfinds your way to a target</li>
<li>/takeall no longer picks up Supply Crates and Barrels</li>
<li>/salvage and /salvageall will now open all nearby Supply Crates and Barrels</li>
<li>Tweaked some things to make the game less frustrating for players who (for whatever reason) want to play the game on mobile devices. FARA still isn't exactly mobile-friendly and I still wouldn't recommend playing it on a phone if you can help it, but this patch should make such a thing far more possible, particularly on Android devices running Chrome.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the dexterity score of certain animals and monsters from being properly applied</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause cooking from the Quick Actions menu to cook the wrong item</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to destroying boulders</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause party members to rob you in your sleep. May re-add.</li>

material of the ammunition they're firing. Softer ammunition like wood and
bone will do less damage than before, while ammunition made from harder
materials like steel and diamond will do more than before.</li>

log.</li>

<li>Interacting with a waterskin or similar container while near a water source
like a river or well will now fill the container. Conversely, interacting with
a well will now fill all waterskins.</li>

now cause you to drink from the river.</li>

thirst.</li>

This one is a doozy. Where do I even start?

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org638d5fd"></a>NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 11:<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-7-10-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Combat and object interactions have been removed from the overworld.
</p>

<p>
Most of the game now takes place at the zoom level once reserved for indoor
spaces and dungeons. While viewing the overworld map, press [ Enter ], [ e ],
or type /explore to drop down to the local level.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As you travel, you will happen upon encounters which automatically trigger
the local view. Having most the game take place at the local level offers
many new and exciting perks:</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Bump to attack!
Under most circumstances, living entities can no longer share the same map
tile. Among other things, this means you can now attack hostile targets by
simply walking into them.</li>

<li>Ranged weaponry in general is now much more viable.</li>

<li>Most interactions that required entities to be on the same tile can now
happen from 1 tile away.</li>

<li>The open spaces allow for more tactical combat. You can utilize terrain
features for cover, stand against large objects to avoid being surrounded, or
climb trees to get a better vantage.</li>

<li>NPC path-finding has been beefed up so they aren't so easily bested by trees
and building corners.</li>

<li>Area of effect spells have been reworked to take advantage of multiple tiles</li>

<li>The jumping mechanic has been reworked, and is now an indispensable tool
when dealing with attackers at range.</li>

<li>Settlements and encampments are now truly explorable areas.</li>

<li>Buildings as items have been removed, and instead players can craft walls and
floor tiles. Using these, you can create any building size and shape you want!</li>

<li>Rivers and ponds are no longer targetable objects, and are instead features
of the landscape you can walk up to and utilize.</li>

<li>Several classes have been tweaked to take advantage of the new mechanics and
space.</li>

<li>Added several new map effects to basic combat</li>

<li>Added pigments! Pigments allow you mark an area with a specific color, and can
be combined to produce every color under the rainbow.</li>

<li>Added a little color variety to the target dots on the map</li>

<li>Added party member items to the /compare window</li>

<li>Reworked the robbery mechanic to be a bit more engaging and straightforward</li>

<li>ADDED THE ABILITY TO PET ANIMALS</li>
</ul>

<p>
Getting all of the old systems up to speed is an ongoing effort, so expect a few
more related patches next week that address new issues like movement speed.

<li>Monk: New Ability: Path of Fire - When Monks jump, they have a chance to set
enemies along their path on fire. When burned, Monks are cleansed of most

command will show in the Quick Actions menu when applicable, and can also be
done with /salvage all, /butcher all, and /butcherall.</li>

<li>Dramatically increased the variety of dungeon monsters with the new prefix
system. These prefixes should give players an idea of what areas a particular
monster may excel, and where they might be vulnerable.</li>

<li>Masterwork items may now be infused with up to two elements, granting the
effects and resistances of both elements.</li>

<li>Revamped the /define command to show multiple results and actually be helpful</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-8-2">
<p>
This is far and away the biggest update FARA has received since its public
release in May 2018, and I'd love your feedback. If you haven't already, please
consider joining us on Discord! <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn">https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn</a>
</p>

<p>
Finally, I want to give a BIG shout out to everyone in the FARA Discord who
helped test earlier versions of this release over the past two weeks. They
suffered tremendously so that you might suffer slightly less. These expansive
changes might have never seen the light of day were it not for their positive
feedback and encouragement, so thanks for taking the time to provide some top
notch insights. There is still plenty of in-game text that needs updating and
bugs that need squashing, so if you come across something that doesn't seem
quite right, be sure to let me know!

<p>
To run this game in linux, this is what you need to know.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
you need sudo access/rights
</p>

<p>
once you unpack the distribution, change to the game directory and issue
</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="org-src-container">

</pre>
</div>

<p>
you likely wont be able to run the game from your file-manager since FARA is technically
a shared library, so, from the shell type <b>./FARA</b> to get it going from its dir.
</p>

<p>
if you want a thing to right-click to start the game, issue:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh"><span style="color: #b0c4de;">echo</span> <span style="color: #9999bb;">./FARA</span> &gt;<span style="color: #b3c0a7;">./fara</span>

</pre>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>save-games go into <b>~/.config/FARA</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
that's chrome's doing and because the save-files are pretty large consider
symlinking that path to a place thats backed-up once a day, not hourly.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
the game plays well under X
</p>

<p>
and since the only time it really need the disk is
 for saving, you can run it from a NAS or server without troubles.
</p>

<p>
/uianimation and screen-shaking should be disabled under X
</p></li>

<li>the actual thing you would appear to need to update between versions,
as long as the runtime does not change is 'resources/app.asar'.
its amazing that its just 2.8mb.</li>

<p>
Pug's experiments suggest:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2+ GHZ,</li>
<li>4ish GB ram for chrome/electron/fara (at most!?)</li>
<li>Anything but not a dual-core cpu!</li>
<li>FARA needs at least three concurrent threads to be performant and having just
a dual-core cpu will ~half the game's speed</li>
<li>Optimal? anything quad-core with DDR-4 ram; DDR-3 will do.</li>
<li>Disk seems not important.</li>
