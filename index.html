Starting with <a href="#org72641a7">0.0.16.5</a> there are new quests, right-clicking on the map moves
you, the sizes of many consumables have been perfected, inventory and storages
can be sorted, the big map became much nicer and overall - there a ton of nice
little tweaks! - <b>the game has become much nicer to play</b>. so cool! Thanks

<h2 id="org6e0aa52"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Caution!</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The game, in alpha for many years now, and while holding the attention of a
loyal playerbase, has a developer's that stated expressly that he has no
interrest in maintaining save-game compatibility.
</p>

<p>
Thus you are advised to go through the trouble of downloading and
installing the game locally so that you will be able to finish games
in progress since using the web-version risks obliteration of your
save at any time!

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
I love the depth and variety in this game. The encounters can be short and
sweet, or long and trecherous. The world has beauty and there is heaps of
creativity in the maps and their many variations. The exploration and combat systems
are challenging yet you never feel as if the game is out to get you.

</blockquote>

<p>
FARA is an open world sandbox that never rushes you to advance, while seeming to
adapt to your powers to keep even low difficulty zones full of surprises. You
will enjoy the turn-based combat, the ability to explore dangerous places with
capable and fearless mercenaries to help. There are 52 classes with unique
traits that simply make sense. The RPG steretypes and classes you know will 
begin to look primitive as you learn to play different classes and explore
FARA's many mysteries.

<h3 id="orgf1cb8ee"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Notes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
This page serves as a repository for my notes about the game. 
</p>

<p>
During my first play-session some years ago I hit a wall and swore to myself
that I would beat this thing one day. And I finally have.
</p>

<p>
It was not a big, triumphant, clever win. Definitely not! I played what looked
to me like the most survivable class, the <a href="#org127fb7e">Gatekeeper</a> as defensively as I could
and for 150 days stuck my head into dangerous places, learning and exploring as
I went - and now that my understanding has grown, my notes and my approach to
them is evolving too.
</p>

<p>
Winning, for me meant 'Completing the Astral Key'. It also marks the beginning
of what puts my Character into the 'Age of Steel', sees me Mining and Fishing
more, and at last! has me manage inventory and items the way the Elders intended.
</p>

<p>
Pug's Notes below don't reflect all I've learned by reaching my milestone yet,
but they are not harmful if you're just starting out.

The note are a single page so they can be searched with ease and confidence.
Use <b>Ctrl-F</b> in your browser to look for things, then press <b>Backspace</b> to return
where you started. 
</p>

<p>
As these notes change 'rolling unannounced updates' appear on the <a href="https://fara-pug.github.io/fara-pug/">web-page
hosted at github</a>. The HTML version I link to has a style-sheet optimized for
readability. I keep meaning to use that for proof-reading.
</p>

<p>
A second, alway in sync version uses a <a href="https://github.com/fara-pug/fara-pug/blob/main/index.md">crisper more technical style</a> that makes
the notes and tables look quite nice also.
</p>

<p>
The writing and production of these docs takes place in Emacs/org-mode since
that's what I know and spend a lot of time with IRL. As every emacs user wants
to spread the gospel, I invite you to take a look at <a href="https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=emacs+org+mode+outline+youtube">some org-mode videos</a>.
Long story short, if/when you try org-mode you'll want to use the <a href="https://github.com/fara-pug/fara-pug">source-document</a>.

<p>
Since my schedule does not allow me to play all that often, find out about
updates to the notes by subscribing to <a href="https://github.com/fara-pug.atom">https://github.com/fara-pug.atom</a> via an
rss-feed reader. I like the <a href="https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=Feedbro+Reader">Feedbro Reader</a> since it works well in almost any
browser. Set the update interval to weekly to catch up with changes and 
improvements to these notes. Set "maximum items to keep" to 1.

<p>
Instead of simply dying and staring at your screen dumbfoundedly, the force
which brought you into the game supports you again by giving you get a chance to
come back to solve the real mysteries of FARA.
</p>

<p>
That's to say, you somehow come back to life, just a little shaken and just a
little bit worse. When you come back, you might suffer or notice one of these
effects (A lot of people died researching this; A moment of silence please!):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Stronger Enemies</li>
<li>Increased Encounter Rate</li>
<li>Increased Damage Taken</li>
<li>Reduced Damage Dealt</li>
<li>Increased Stamina Use</li>
<li>Reduced Food Effects</li>
<li>Reduced Inventory Capacity (-5 per blight)</li>
<li>Reduced Strength</li>
<li>Reduced Finesse</li>
<li>Reduced Resilienc</li>
<li>Reduced Insight</li>
<li>Reduced Charm</li>
</ul>


<p>
Each of these Blights decreases your chances of resurrecting again. Exactly what
that means is unclear.. except that it will prevent you from cultivating your follies.
</p>

<p>
Feedback:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I got 4 Blights once. I never got more than 4, though this doesn't necessarily
mean its impossible. It would require a lot of testing to be sure.</li>
<li>Taking the first blight is a guaranteed success I think? I never had it fail,
and it does make sense.</li>
<li>Do not attack Relica's elder. He will end your run, and no amount of blights
will ever save you from his unending wrath.</li>
<li>I think you might have an increased chance of levelling up a blight instead of
getting a new one if you already have it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
My testing was not extensive, I only kept going until I was pretty sure I'd seen
all the blights. tbh 1, 2, and 4 would require some very rigorous testing to be
sure.

<p>
Your charm doesn't increase your ability to lead a party and it does
not affect your party's maximum size. (max party size may be class dependent)
</p>

<p>
Charm does make it easier to form good relationships with NPCs, meaning that
with more charm <b>/joke</b>, <b>/gossip</b>, etc. will be better received and they
will think you more of a friend for doing quests for them.
</p>

<p>
Unsure how that matters. Will they remember your birthday? Give more loot?
</p>

<p>
More important.. If charm is luck and insight searching, then why isn't everyone
talking about making shovels and fishing-rods from crystal or even obsidian?
I think some testing is in order.. Can it be that people don't like setting up
house on the beach? Whats going on there..

I read that each new shard contibutes more points to your score than the previous one.

<p>
Thus if you aim to level up your stats by putting shards into them you should do
it with the 9th shard so that you collect the most unlock points for doing that.

If you're strong enough to move to another settlement, can you turn your naked

meta-game of animal researcher?

<p>
there are 5 primary stats. lets say they average '10 of 20'. you'd need 50 9th
shards to become a god. that's 500 new animal species discovered, and maybe 500
days spent in game.

hmm, lol, i wonder how long brute-forcing 10 find-animal quests would take and
if i could resist the urge to just complete the key to be done with the game.

The first interaction I had with him was to buy something unknown of course. And
what I got wasn't a random thing, but a rune I had never seen before! Trying again
of course I got a very highly rated rune, the rune of spears. But I already had one
of thos in inventory. 
</p>

<p>
So I don't know. Did his psychic let him give me one kind of rune that I had never had
before then picking something destructive randomly? I'll have to solicit and wait for
feedback to get clear on that, or try it again in the next game. Respect!

I might have missed an item there, but suddenly he asked for a crafted input,
turning <b>bone nunchucks &gt; swordchucks</b>.
</p>

<p>
After he wanted the nunchucks he started asking for wooden blocks. Perhaps we're
coming close to a new materials tier after 12..13 runs.. Verry nice, very
grindy, very medal-expensive!
</p>

<p>
<b>3 wooden blocks &gt; wooden anvil</b>
</p>

<p>
Afterwards he wanted bones again..
</p>

<p>
Anyway, now i can consult the <a href="#org9110787">Materials Tables</a> and better versions
of his more sensible items. neat!
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Keeping these prototypes makes sense to me right now.</li>

<li>Signs.. used to be terribly important in the old version i played. Perhaps
they have a discoverable function..</li>

<li>I guess I have to keep feeding him till he comes up with a pickaxe for mining!</li>

<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-5-1-1-3-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fishmonger's really grindy if you want to do it</li>
<li>Get a whole lot of dowels</li>
<li>Waypoint your spawn area</li>
<li>Once you've got a huge amount of dowels</li>
<li>Get a crystal/iron/bronze fishing rod</li>
<li>Any uncommon tier fishing rod</li>
<li>Crafted with wooden blocks</li>
<li>Used for tools</li>
<li>So you've got your huge pile of dowels</li>
<li>(~100)</li>
<li>wow</li>
<li>And your uncommon fishing rod</li>
<li>Preferably iron, since it's easiest</li>
<li>(find a fortress and salvage the doors)</li>
<li>(You need to craft a wooden fishing rod to unlock other recipes)</li>
<li>Now, go back to spawn with the lake</li>
<li>And fish until the rod's ruined</li>
<li>With the Fishmonger trait, you should have enough runes to salvage into runic shards and make a repair kit with your dowels + shards</li>
<li>Use the repair kit to repair the rod</li>
<li>Repeat that process</li>
<li>passing down anchient knowlage</li>
<li>You should slowly get enough extra runic shards to craft refined tools (25 shards)</li>
<li>Use them on the fishing rod</li>
<li>Continue fishing until the rod is [ruined] and repairing the rod by salvaging the runes</li>
<li>Make it artisan (50 shards)</li>
<li>Then start making your other equipment refined</li>
<li>And then artisan</li>
<li>secret knowlage here wow</li>
<li>You should also get a whole bunch of runes that are useful for you</li>
<li>Get a rune of curses and a rune of intoxication</li>
<li>And set them aside when you get them</li>
<li>Once you've got both, drop them in the same place and use /makespell or /ms</li>
<li>You will now have an arcane curse of intoxication</li>
<li>Fishmonger takes significantly reduced damage while intoxicated, so you can /selfcast 3 to give yourself an arcane curse of intoxication</li>
<li>The reason the element chosen is arcane is because very few entities use the arcane element</li>
<li>And curse spells increase damage taken from an element</li>
<li>The intoxication rune has to be on an attacking spell, since it's a negative effect</li>
<li>Basically You curse yourself with intoxication + increased arcane damage taken</li>
<li>i knew thats an exploit. i just thought i could use some vodka or smth :slight<sub>smile</sub>:</li>
<li>But nothing really uses the arcane element so you only really get intoxication</li>
<li>Yes, you can use vodka and all other alcohol</li>
<li>so in summery fish fish fish curse fish fish fish and get POWA</li>
<li>Fishmonger has 2 spell slots, so you can make a second spell too</li>
<li>the intox debuff gives you +RES and +CHA</li>
<li>But once you have a bunch of booze and a tower shield then you are practically unkillable</li>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-5-1-1-4">

<li><a id="org3d28e34"></a><a href="https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Class_Tips">Tips from the Wiki</a><br />
<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-5-1-1-4-1">
<p>
Gatekeeper's are very good at protecting allies, making them very good at escort quests. Their Protect ability allows them to half all incoming damage dealt to an ally, at the cost of around 1/3 of your stamina. They automatically deflect projectiles aimed toward them, and their armor takes less durability damage from combat and wear-and-tear alike.
</p>

<p>
Some good ways to effectively use Gatekeeper are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Try and always keep a Silencing spell ready. Silencing enemies prevents them from spellcasting anything that hinders your ability to use Protect or any other spells.</li>
<li>Gatekeepers have Average Strength and Finesse at the start, so its up to you whether you want to use ranged or melee weapons.</li>
<li>Its also a good idea to keep meals/mixtures/dishes with either Strength or Finesse buffs on hand for temporary buffs.</li>
<li>Shields are very useful to Gatekeepers. With full armor and a shield that has Average or higher damage reduction, there is a chance that the Gatekeeper will be able to take about 2-3 hits without dealing direct damage to your Health.</li>

<p>
Botanist is one of the interesting classes you can use in Fara, their unique
ability "Familiar Phytology" has a huge potential if you know how to use it
efficiently. First of all let's see what the ability is about.
</p>

<p>
Familiar Phytology - Botanists have access to the Enrich Plant skill, which
allows them to turn any plant into allied Plant baby. Feeding Plant Babies by
hand will cause them to grow more powerful, and the chosen food will determine
what abilities/skills they have. Casting Enrich Plant while already having a
plant familiar will kill the older familiar.
</p>

<p>
Basically after using the "Enrich Plant" skill of the botanist on trees or
bushes will turn them into an ally plant baby. An allied plant has a total of 4
stages.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Baby, Kid, Beast, Behemoth</li>
</ul>

<p>
As you may have read earlier plant allies can be evolved by being hand fed
anything that is edible. You will need a total of 55 food to max out the
evolution process of your plant, but always remember to think about on what the
55th food will be since that will determine what type of behemoth you will get!
Other than being being able to get them from your first day in your run, you can
make new ones that will be stronger the farther you are from Relica! So far I
have only tapped into Veteran behemoths but I think there are far more stronger
variants the farther we go, for now I will show the stats of an amateur ones
below.
</p>

<p>
Number of how many you have to feed before evolving along with stats and skills
</p>

<p>
This may help you in the early run if you can get them into a behemoth fast
since you may also get a mercenary as another companion with your first battle
chest reward when you get to Relica. The stats will go up as you make plant
allies when you are farther Relica, and also another good thing is it will not
cost you anything other than some few seeds and berries here and there.
</p>

<p>
and their type (which determines attunement,
spells, and stats) is based on what you feed them.

<p>
This class excels in melee combat due to Its Good Resilience and Above Average
Strength/Health, which allows this class to take lots of damage while dealing
good damage up close. 'Know Thy Foe' also Silences enemies, preventing them from
spellcasting. Classes that rely on spells are at a huge disadvantage against
this class.

<p>
Some good ways to effectively use Demon Slayer are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Always keep spells that give you Rage, Fortification, and/or Rejuvenation, on
you. These spells will come in handy if you cast them before you engage an
enemy.</li>
<li>Hearty and Robust Meals/Mixtures/Dishes are good for temporary buffs before
you fight something or explore dungeons.</li>
<li>Try to keep most, if not all, battles up close. You can choose to raise

Reaper is a very complex class to play. With low health and strength, its hard
to get kills without learning spells. Some of the most important runes you will
need are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rejuvenation, Fortification, Blinding, Silencing</li>
</ul>

<p>
Another drawback is its ability 'Deathsense', which buffs strength and insight
when a nearby entity is close to dying. With low strength to start out with,
getting close and trying to melee is very hard, and can kill you nearly every
time without the proper equipment. Having at least one healing spell is crucial
to playing this class, as you will find out your health gets drained in a matter
of a couple rounds.

Samurai Showdown - When a Kensai draws an item while targeting a charging enemy,
they will immediately dash to their target, delivering a powerful strike. This
ability only works when the target is uninjured, and has a small chance to

strike chance against opponents in offensive stances.

<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-5-1-7-5-1">
<p>
Kensai's are good at quick damage dealing. Their 'Samurai Showdown' ability has
a wide variety of uses, including the ability to practically teleport to an area
in an instant. Depending on how you want to play Kensai, the class is very
expendable.
</p>

<p>
Some good ways to play Kensai are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>'Samurai Showdown' doesn't have to be used against a target. Since the ability
allows you practically teleport, you can use this to your advantage by
teleporting away from an enemy or conflict that you have a low chance of
winning. Due to the amount of stamina it uses, it is really more of a last
resort.</li>
<li>If you have a ranged weapon (either a sling or bow), you can try this.</li>
<li>Shoot your target at range and keep an even distance. If you feel the target
is getting too close, use 'Samurai Showdown' to teleport behind the target,
then keep shooting at range. This will help limit the damage you take
significantly if you play your cards right</li>
<li>The Fury you get after dashing through an enemy boosts your critical damage,
so it's a good idea to have either a light or an illumination spell to
guarantee a critical hit.</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-5-1-7-6">
<p>
The Greatest - Pugilists build up a combo counter while attacking unarmed,
dealing more damage with each consecutive hit. This counter is reset if they
miss an attack, wait too long, or lose their target. Landing 3 attacks in a row
will daze the target, landing a 4th will stun it, and landing a 5th will knock
it prone and deal heavy damage. If the final blow kills the target, the Pugilist
will be rewarded with a belt of random quality.

The attacks don't have to be consecutive, and only the last one has to hit a target for the song to start.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-6">
<p>
There are eight types of damage in FARA.
</p>

<p>
Physical attacks are countered by "Damage Reduction" provided those held shield
items in combination with Resilience and Strength, i suppose.
</p>

<p>
Magical attacks are countered by your elemental attunement which is enhanced by
your Insight? and a shield spell. Did I get that right?

<li>slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing,</li>
<li>(see Radiant hand trait if you're looking for physical resistances)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ranged</li>
</ul>

<p>
Elemental runes on your weapon give you a bonus and weaken your target.
</p>

<p>
If you have more than one elemental rune on your weapon, then they will
alternate with each hard attack you make.
</p>

<p>
FARA canon seems to be to use a single water-rune on your weapon and nothing
else since a little bit of extra water-attunement will make your rejuvenating
healing spell work ever so much better for you &#x2013; and of course weaken your
foe's water/healing attunement as well.

Mobs don't seem to use it nor do they appear to have resistance against it.
If you feel like doing without the elemental effects, think 'arcane'.
</p>

<p>
if you use an arcane shield or other rare arcane infused elements you do more
damage and resist arcane spells

It is technically possible to get traits from multiple factions, but it requires
some grinding as each medal given to a faction will decrease your reputation
with the other two. You can also try to do some Reputation juggling by getting
the Diplomat trait and/or being the Politician class to obtain maximum rep with
more than one faction at a time.

You have three changeable trait slots! In addition to your unchangeable class
trait, you have two minor trait slots and one major trait slot you get to pickup
and repeatedly change out through study and with the help of your Faction.

<li>Raw food provides some stamina but no healing.</li>
<li>Cooked foods provide much more stamina and restore a fixed health%.</li>
<li>Its not clear if or how the health boost varies.</li>
<li>They are 1u small.</li>
<li>Buffs from food <b>replace</b> each other.</li>
<li>mixtures, dishes and booze can drop from mobs and crates.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="#org050a026">Alchemist</a>'s <b>Mixtures</b> provide higher stat bonuses for fewer ingredients and can
be consumed much faster. Throwing Mixtures at enemies will lower the relevant
stats, and throwing Mixtures at other entities will raise the relevant stats.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org4545101">Botanists</a> can do all sorts of magic by feeding their babies just about anything.
Their babies evolve when they feed them. Your pets wont.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgb9c2c20">Chef</a>'s <b>Dishes</b> provide stat bonuses for four times the duration of Meals, and
grant an effect which fixes the eater's mood to max for an extended period.
</p>

<p>
Eating and drinking (<b>/eat</b>, <b>/drink</b>) take time. <b>Water</b> and <b>Mixtures</b>
are probably hugely important for spellcasters in dire situations, but I'd need
an expert to chime in with their experience as I'm just guessing here.

Due to the presence of rift-energies in the land, its important that you
bookmark locations your're engaged with. Leaving them unobserved will not be
enough to keep them from drifting away from where you thought they were.
</p>

<p>
The attention bound by personal and quest bookmarks appears to attract these
drifters while the content of the world around you reorganizes itself when you
sleep. None of the citizens in your world, except perhaps elder and nobles would
appear to be aware of this.
</p>

<p>
Practically this means that special location like the ones listed here can
<b>often</b> be found in areas adjecent to or in the immediate vicinity of the sites
you have bookmarked. Settlements with their histories and many minds appear less
volatile.
</p>

<p>
All said, a good observer will often find fascinating places, as if by accident,
when they wake up after resting (well sheltered one hopes) in the woods!
</p>

<p>
tl;dr? Peek into the 8 immediate neighbors of the bookmarks you're given and
possibly walk through the 16 surrounding squares to see what's out there!
</p>

<p>
Indoor locations such as Castles and Fortresses offer free and secure overnight
lodgings.

on almost every step on the way to pick up that loot.

<p>
The Burning House can be a real oh-sh*t experience. It could be on any tile that
you stumble on pyromanic imps that shoot you with magma right when you land. I
didn't find any until I had complete all the buildings in Relica and it may be
ok to save your paranoia until then.
</p>

<p>
Extrapolating from my random encouter I suspect the imps were not really
malicious, simply driven to madness by the guy making horrible music. I mean,
wouldn't he live in town with his &lt;random instrument&gt; if people appreciated his
music?
</p>


<p>
I wish I had not forgotten to <b>/grab</b> and drag the unconscious SOB off the edge
of the map to get him looked after. Which makes me think of something! Do you
know that if you're dragging something or someone, all you need to do to let go,
is to hold something else in that hand. Say you happen to get attacked, just
draw your weapon and you'll let go what you were pulling.
</p>

<p>
And hey, and hey, most people dont mind if you drag them around. The ingame
message about 'attacking' is just worded a bit strongly for most circumstances.

would have talked to them first if they hadn't gone all hostile on you, right?

<p>
A real <b>&lt;Gem&gt;</b> from Discord!
</p>

<p>
"It was a random encounter, there was 1 small building, 2 commoners, and 1 farmer
NPC. The farmer NPC only gave quests to collect and return 2-3 crops (items)
from around the map, rewarding a tool chest or small check for each completed
quest.
</p>

<p>
I could repeat these indefinitely, and after a while, the chests became refined,
and then artisan. The artisan small chests gave artisan items, which I mostly
salvaged, giving me runic shards.  Basically, the farmer is a safe and infinite
(albeit a little tedious) source of runic shards."

On entering the hunting grounds you can find a group of hunters heavily injured,
and a lot of corpses around the place. After talking to one of them you can
accept a mission to help them against the Rift Beast that left them in that
condition.
</p>

<p>
Rift beasts are one of the toughest opponents in FARA, one of them comes to
fight you after accepting to help the hunters that show up in the hunting
grounds.

They are a challenge for any type of character, so being prepared is very important.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-4-11-2-12">
<p>
You come across 6/7? to 9 delapidated buildings in this frequent, somewhat hard
yet doable encounter.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning count yourself lucky if you manage to dash to the egde
undetected. If you have some wood on hand keep in mind that you can get out if
you're near the edge and that you can place the occasional extra wall or
building to beef up your position &#x2013; especially if you're playing melee &#x2013; to
break the line of sight against what will inevitably be small groups of often stealthy
casters coming after you here.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>stealth-clustered magic attackers and friends all appear to use the same element!</li>
<li>bring some <a href="#org46bfa25">elemental foods</a> for yourself and your team, and of course a beverage!</li>
<li>getting the Big Chest from the local mini boss doesnt mean you're safe!</li>

<li>use stealth, enter, drop building, move to cover!</li>
<li>sevral ruined storage chest. one obsidean shard always drops here.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Sometimes though it seems as if the crew guarding the ruins has been tipped of
about your plans to attack them, and they will all be standing by your spawn point.
</p>

<p>
In these circumstances being a Gatekeeper allows you to put on your second big
shield, cast protect, a ward of fury for maximum retaliation while you attempt
to get out of that mess. If you're lucky, almost all the spellcaster will kill
themselves trying to hurt as you're making your exit.

<p>
These travelers seem to have a traitor between them.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Talk to them to figure out who it is!</li>
</ul>

<p>
As you traverse the world of FARA you might come upon caravans along your way. A
caravan consist of 5 travellers and talking to any of them you'll find out that
they have recently been attacked. They suspect one of their own, and this gives
you the chance to play detective.
</p>

<p>
Each person will list how long they've been with the group, their personal
reason for travelling, as well as a good and bad thing to do at their
destination. These are the clues to identify the odd one out.
</p>

<p>
As a reward for solving the mystery you gain the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1x big chest,</li>
<li>1x artisan tool kit,</li>
<li>2x randomized tools,</li>
<li>1x iron shiv,</li>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="orge421046"></a>Tips for solving the mystery<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-11-2-17-1">
<p>
Typically the activities mentioned fall into the following categories [study],
[trade], [relaxing], [family], and [entertainment]. You will need to talk to all
the travellers and figure out which one they report as the absolute worst to do
at the destination. If two activities are tied, one of them is unlikely to be
used as an alibi by anyone. Confronting and accusing the traveller who says
they're going there for this purpose will unlock a fight. The culprit will turn
hostile and try to kill you. Two ambushers will show up and assault the culprit
first, and you second. After winning the fight you can peacefully collect the
rewards.
</p>

<p>
At the type of writing, it is unclear if telling on the culprit will just fail
the event.
</p>

<p>
Once the event is over all travellers that have not been accused (you could
accuse the wrong one and fail the event) will offer a quest, similar to
commoners in towns.

Mayhem ensued, loot dropped and in the end only the guy sitting the furthest
away from the action survived the assault by the accused's pals. three dead
to solve a robbery. wth! 
</p>

<p>
now the shivering sole survivor and inheritor of all the trashy loot i can't
haul away want to make funeral music with a clay triangle. a clay triangle!
one moment while i get him one..
</p>

<p>
wait! one body is missing. ah! one more survivor after all. he freaked out and
ran away.  good for him.

A series of corridors and rooms, guarded by traps, ancient guardians and many

Just that. Empty woods, Orange Square. Hollow eyes look at me and the figure
vanishes before I can inspect them. Spooky. Is he the guy taking all the kids I
can't find? Was he in one of the graves I dug up? What did I stumble on? I just
needed a wooden log! Should I dig there? /pug wonders on, then, wait! ..
</p>

<p>
Awakening as from a dream, he recalls the moment his memories began. There he
had seen that figure loitering over one of the bandits that keep coming after
him and his cow. Did that figure save him from a certain death? Is he somehow
connected to that society of researchers only elders seem to know about?

<h4 id="org2c259d4"><span class="section-number-4">4.12.1</span> Wiki preamble</h4>

<p>
I sooo hope that the wiki/source is more than mostly right on this info
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>source: <a href="https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Crafting_Materials">https://fara.fandom.com/wiki/Crafting_Materials</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
There is an abundance of different materials and most of them seem to be
associated with some kind of stat altering capabilities, that you can gain by
wearing or holding the item. In addition to the material you use when crafting,
the item you are crafting itself may have some base properties making up the
total attribute impact.
</p>

<p>
Weaponry, jewellery, and armour is made from wood, bone, scale, glass, and
minerals, while clothing items are made from cloths and furs - with a few
overlaps such as boots.
</p>

<p>
Note that at this time the precise number of stat pluses given by each material
is unknown, as it is not equivalent to the number of arrows a piece of equipment
has.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(stat)&gt; gives +1</li>
<li>(stat)&gt;&gt; gives +2 or +3</li>
<li>(stat)&gt;&gt;&gt; gives +4, +5, or +6</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each additional nth arrow gives an additional n possible boosts (4 arrows giving
between +7 and +10, etc.)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Pug: Crafting appears to take 100 (105?) moments. fwiw.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-13-3">
<p>
As elsewhere the stories I tell about the different characters and their
fantastic schemes and relations are entirely fantastic and straight from my
imagination.
</p>

<p>
I write them for the same reason that I don't cheat: Even a little bit of
storytelling keeps the fantasy alive and prevents play from becoming a grind.
</p>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol">

Remember they are Faction Leaders.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-4-13-3-2">
<p>
The combat dummies you'll find in all settlements give you a taste of the damage
put out by attackers of different ranks. By going between towns and challenging
different dummies you can experiment with your offensive options to learn how
small differences between weapons and styles that don't show up when you look at
only item stats.
</p>

<p>
That experiment might be quite a geeky thing, but we should have a table here to
demonstrate the power hiding in different <a href="#orga3ac4c9">Skill Brackets</a>.

Source of infinite unique items of middling power .. which .. when you have
collected way to many, might allow you to think yourself as well equipped as
someone solidly in 'The Age of Steel'. Perhaps a little better than that; But
as the quality of their Thank you's vary quite a bit, its not unheard of to find
their dead bodies in Dungeons and Monster Dens.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-4-13-3-5">
<p>
The Gambler/ "Shady Gamer" is actually really useful!
</p>

<p>
If you have a ton of runic dust, you can use the gambler to get any tool recipes
you don't have yet, and more importantly, get very rare materials.
</p>

<p>
He gives you 25% odds, for an average price of 4 dust per win :) 
</p>

<p>
Not bad at all. A friend suggests you take the odd because you savscumming the
shady isnt just shadierer, it won't guarantee you an outcome either. Still, if
you must at least keep betting on the same choice each time or simply make
<a href="https://www.startpage.com/sp/search?query=monty+hall+problem">another choice each next round</a> and stick with that. I can't believe I just told

<blockquote>
<p>
I had something similar happen to me in a past run, where I rested
overnight at a castle. Woke up, had a bunch of good stuff swiped, and there was
a random commoner just standing there with those very items. Tried stealing them
back, which didn't work, and they started running away. Out of desperation, I
yelled at them, hoping the guards would dogpile the thief. They dropped the
items and ran off. Guards just sat there.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>/say thief</b> gets them to drop everything they stole and act embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
That does not appear to work in the wilderness where there are no guards around.
</p>

<p>
pug/more:
</p>

<p>
After winning by assembling the key, I met my first thief because I had gotten
complacent about closing the door in Relica. Since then I've experimented, and
thieves have appeared <b>every</b> single night, sometimes taking not just my weapon
but also upto two pieces of armor. That's going from never to always, making me
think that <b>winning was a bad idea!</b>  Lets hope I've run into a bug here.
</p>

<p>
p.s. In a castle or other 'location where you dont control the doors' you can 
strip down naked and rest without fear since thieves don't seem to care about the
stash you're resting on.

You can figure these out by your self, don't sweat them. If there's trouble you
had to run from, kids or monsters or items and belongings you can't find, drop
the damn quest without penalty and get a new batch from the elder, the always
needy people of the realm and/or those workers you brought into your settlement.

<p>
Here are some really dumb observations about quests:

There are more types tied to specific locations. I need to add more info here.

Listen man, I know you want to make a name for yourself, impress the Elder and
all that; Don't deny it, we've all been there. But let me give me you a hint
about this thing you dont want to ask about &#x2026; Those tracks you're looking for,
they have the beast's name in it and 9 out of ten times you find them in one of
the 8 directions just a single step away from the settlement. That other time,
you'll to take two steps to find them.

See, I saw you pondering. Yep, that's why you couldn't find that monster the
other day. Now be careful reading the tracks!

<p>
You know that times are desperate when almost overyone, no, make that everyone
you meet that's not out to kill you offers you ancestral heirlooms as rewards
for things you've never seen.
</p>

<p>
Needy as they are, they want foods that noone in their right mind would care to
eat, Weapons and other items you have never heard of. And they send you to
<a href="#org541b9a7">unknown places</a> too. Always they have needs in places you've never been, make you
deliver the weirdest trinkets or their odd selves to hard to find people
and places. The heirlooms from their illustrious ancestors, those medals,
just like their inane request never seem to run out.
</p>

<p>
Well, ok, some of the folks that you ferry between places are actually
interesting to talk to and would appear new to the game and a bit naive as
they just give you unique and valuable items that you can actually use.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you stumbled upon some underground railroad where people of different
factions are relocating all over the map because they are planning something.

you don't need to make light to find them again whence back in town and they
start playing their games. For that you need to have <a href="#orgafd31f0">local waypoints</a> by which to
move yourself through the settlement without going nuts. Do you have those?
</p>

<p>
And then you learn about how to make Burlap Dolls. Or perhaps they have that
very last exclusive item elite tier BP you had forgotten you wanted. I might
never learn what they are about cause I can't find the buggers!
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I find tracks leading to unknown dens instead of children. Are these
really just another type of innvitation to suicide myself?  Do i really need to
press "s" so that I <b>/search</b> every square inch of the site? Or should I stop
being of attracting attention and just run around the location and <b>/shout come
here</b>? Probably.

(excerpt from a letter by future pug.)
</p>

<p>
When you get to a new settlement a cheeky elder there is likely to invite you,
the stranger, to suicide by quest.
</p>

<p>
Accept then drop any kill-a-champion and other suspicious sounding quests after
visiting their locations without entering. Turn their game against them by going
there to scout for landmarks of interrest in the general area. Enter a few
random tiles nearby to look for 'who knows what' that spawned there!
</p>

<p>
Wait with the scary quests until you have legendary stats and artisan equipment,
or something close to that. Or wait until you are already thriving at a place
even further from Relica than where you first got the suicide invitations.

If they are suffering from an effect, the caster is cleansed from these effects
when they cast the spell causing it. To make this work, casting Silencing is
possible even when you are silenced.

</ul>

<p>
Basically, you
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>chose an elemental rune to determine what type of damage and what elemental
effect it does,</li>
<li>a “stabilizer” to determine what type of spell it is (long range, AoE, etc)
and</li>
<li>an effector rune to apply additional effects when you cast it (like blinding
enemies, getting buffs on yourself, etc</li>
</ul>

<p>
More:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Spell type + 2 elements + effect  adds random stabilizer</li>
<li>If you don't use any elemental runes, only a stabilizer and effector, you get an arcane spell</li>
<li>You can put 2 spells on weapons and armor.  (scrolls /use</li>
<li>Curse spell + any damaging spell is a really good combo to get</li>
<li>in case you want to know spear and blade are generally considered good spells</li>
</ul>

<p>
Shielding:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Two elements (preferably including water)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>rune of shields + rune of rejuvenation gives what I consider the best spell in the game.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Because shield increases attunement to all elements, but does so more so for
the elements included in its spell. This makes it so you can max an attunement
with a shield of that element + 3(? 2? it's been a while since I played) runes
on Masterwork equipment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
New:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Okay, something I did discover is that you can make randomized spells with

The second kind of is obviously better and rarer and I get the sense that the
someone who makes them was more likely to use his or her rarest runes on them so
that they could learn their complicated spells at will in the future. But as all
of the uncommon runes seem rarest to me at this point, I can't judge that right.

<li><a id="org0b7d397"></a>Water Chain of Rejuvenation<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-4-19-3-1">
<p>
I wound up making a "Water Chain of Rejuvenation" and upgraded it using Obelisk
Shards until it became "Flawless". Its not that great with my stats yet but it
doubles as an offensive spell which keeps enemies where they are while i heal a
little every turn for a few turns. It might be awesomer for a ranged class to
use chain spells, but its good enough to keep melee guys from ganging up on me
too badly.
</p>

<p>
I know you experts out there are saying to yourselves.. what an idiot, doesn't
he know.. and I want to stop you right there! I know its not perfect, but its
fine to have to drop an item from your pack if there's not anything else in
range for you to cast the chain on.
</p>

<p>
Anyway.. I had no shield runes when I made the spell 50 days ago. And I still
don't have one, nor did I get another rejuvenation rune since. So if you like
hoarding to figure things out, try not to be stupid about it, these things are
meant to be used .. and you can always spend a week fishing and digging at a
beach. I will ;)

I did some testing about the light element, apparently at no attunement the
illumination debuff lasts for about a single attack
</p>

<p>
At max level it's about 10 moments
</p>

<p>
The critical damage doesn't seem to scale with attunement, just its duration
</p>

<p>
Right after the illumination fades, the target is !revealed for a single turn
</p>

<p>
Still not sure if +critical damage stacks with other sources
</p>

<p>
Ok, this may not be conclusive, but an obsidian mace with a |hardened tack|
takes about 4 hits to kill a combat dummy. If you have the Fury condition it
takes only 3 hits

As you will see later in this guide there are several tiers of materials in
FARA. And for argument's sake lets call the main material you're using and
finding, equivalent to being in an age.
</p>

<p>
You'll be able to survive many if not most of the random encounters near Relica
with relative ease since the Amateur opponents you meet so close to the hub of
lowest difficulty don't have equipment better than yours.
</p>

<p>
Spending time near Relica allows you to not just learn the game but collect any
number of recipes for later use since your ability to re-craft anything you find
using materials is unmatched. Getting these materials, learning the nuances of
your gear and how to enhance it properly lets you you advance advancing to
somet like a later age.

<p>
As you find your basic stats and damage resistance risen to something like 'the
iron' age Magic, that is elemental attacks become more of an issue for you.
</p>

<p>
Enter the elemental resistance which you now learn to give to your gear by
applying runes to it. Letting these get to average and better is quite a 
challenge and a profound mystery at first.
</p>

<p>
You have access to elemental runes that you can apply to your gear, situational
food and drink providing buffs, even a Commander Level Faction Trait to help
resist the most devious of enemies!

</p>

<p>
There are several buildings of which you'll want to expand at least the
warehouse within the first few weeks game-time. It offers a way to access quite
a bit of stuff from elsewhere. A local waypoint at the spawn and on the
warehouse donation chest will save you a lot of time.
</p>

<p>
"<b>W</b>" makes zooming around the local map quick and convenient. That is unless
there are doors, pets, npc, or even the well along the path. Its not perfect yet
but "<b>W</b>" is a huge help. Use <b>/slw</b> until it becomes a habit.

air as your body materializes &#x2013; and that scatters anything you might have left
there through the immediate area. Try it out.

<p>
Anyway, I'm still learning to play the game and I have yet to win. But this is
my second run at it in 3 years and I find that starting as a horder with a base
in Relica is again teaching me what I don't need or want, and how to deal with
everything else. Here's the scoop on what works for me.

After thriving for 132 days I'm ready to leave this layout behind.
</p>

<p>
I worked beautifully. I used just two storages and was able to do get in 
and out very quickly. But now that I <b>want</b> storages I'm make the warehouse
into Pug's house and place 8 storages around the crucible. This frees up a
workbench and allow the main problem with this layout &#x2013; the escortees that
I wound up bringing into relica to no longer cramp my style. Mind you, they
go their own way after you're not in town for a while, but its better this
lest I give another precious item to them or the elder by accident.
</p>

<p>
So as last night, this is the concept:

<li>Tooly all my "{&lt;(Equipment)&gt;}", all Shards, Medals, Lights, Lockpicks &amp;

</ul>

<p>
This leaves huge piles of crystals &amp; leather and the problem of cooked foods.
</p>

<p>
I've not worked it out, but there will be 8 firepits and some kind of sensible
way of dealing with buff/food preparation further south in the warehose.
</p>

<p>
Remains to be seen what if any kinds of walls I wind up putting in there and
if I'm not going to play house some more by putting bed and brazier by the

<p>
"There is nothing in any of my warehouses .. except in Relica's." - pug.
</p>

<p>
First off, I don't really like the slow interaction with the storage bins in the
warehouse. 
</p>

<p>
Instead of holding an item-stack to put it into the the number 1 position and 
typing <b>/giveall</b>, I <b>/give #x</b> if its a single item and drop whatever stacked
item right on top of the bins.
</p>

<p>
I dont use scrolls but I keep them in a bin next to the crucible because I
already know that I will be desperate for them when I'm strong enough to get
myself into the best part of the game I know, dungeons! (Please don't read that
to mean that my avatar is mindless about hoarding. After all, some scrolls were
meant to be /salvaged and he's read enough of this guide to know that!)
</p>

<p>
Sure, as player, I could <b>/salvage</b> everything, but my avatar isn't wired like
that. He keeps fancy but not the fanciest kites, beehives, birds-nests, folded
notes, toyswords and other things like that for flavour. Once in the warehouse,
but these things are out of sight, not out of mind.
</p>

<p>
After opening up the (Refinery) I wound up with oddities like Tin Fiddles and
Organs, Bone Spears and Goggles. I love the recipes, but instead of salvaging
them right I stash away the Smith's output in the warehouse get an insight into
what he's doing, knowing full well that the stash doubles as a rune-shard hoard.
</p>

<p>
Ammo. I got tons of ammo of all kinds. When I get a new ranged weapon I try them out
and keep the nicest ones in a Storage box on which i all dump all spare ammo. I find
that much easier than placing stacks into the box.
</p>

<p>
But listen, before you stash anything you find or loot, beat-up and or salvage
the whatever because especially among the items you find on trees, surprises await!

fumbling around in a dark maze trying to find a key and a door, dealing with
stealthed enemies, and hidden traps! Dungeons are not the best part of the
game. At all.

several iron pieces or whatever is best for your needs.

Take your workbench when you dig so you dont need to make repair kits. Your
enhanced shovel will stay sharp that way. If you get bored digging, repeat the

Is this me; am i unlucky with the maps i picked? can i only have so much luck
per day ingame? All these are open questions, I'll try fishing again later and
see if my luck improves, after wearing out an entire workbench trying that's all
i can do.

We all know your avatar's a bit sensitive and often drops down to the local
level because they sensed danger or spotted some cockroaches fight one another.
</p>

<p>
If the circle is blank of enemies, or you can make it so with a few steps away
from the fight, do that! more often than not "<b>X</b>" <b>/exit</b> or clicking on your
waypoint will take you out and put you back on the road!
</p>

<p>
And hey, if "<b>X</b>" fails, it will have moved you to the action without you having
to look for it. This is really helpful if you cast a shield on yourself before
doing do, esp. if your're traveling at night, yet again without a light.

I use this ~38 step pattern to explore new locations so that i see almost all
the map with little effort. Mobs and trees will change this a little bit, but
its good enough:

<p>
Using the "<b>-</b>" view of the map is also really important to me because some of
the locations look great, and its good to know the lay of the land because 
sometimes I'll pick a different corner to go to first based on what I see
</p>


<p>
Keeping Relica as a base around which I explore at varying distances makes
investing into it viable and worthwhile. Thus I've painted up my map with paths
that let me see every time to do local quests for the NPC's quickly to efficiently
level up their loot drop, added lots of waypoints to get to all the places and people
without having to look where I'm going, and am now thinking seriously about just what
kind of storages to trick out my warehouse with.
</p>

<p>
People in the advanced stages of the game talk about traveling 1200++ km from
Relica, fighting unheard of monsters from unheard of dimensions while still
investing there. So that's good enough for me.
</p>

<p>
I don't know enough about the way the difficulty scales, but as I progress in
the game I'll be keeping an eye out for new locations, hoping I find something
that lets me have settlement hubs that are roughly a full day's travel from one
another as I expand.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-8-2">
<p>
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to travel by stealth to and
from Relica by steps and by fast-travel in order to determine and confirm for
your self just how far away you can go before the safe-mode fast traveling or
exhaustion stops you from going any further.
</p>

<p>
Keep that distance in mind as you quest or explore and be careful! Don't just
try this using fast-travel to another settlement. You might drown yourself if
you do!

<h3 id="org839e48f"><span class="section-number-3">5.9</span> Difficulty</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-9">
<p>
FARA's difficulty is a gem. Yes, really. I don't know the formula, but like you,
I appreciate that the things you encounter in your travels seem to slowly get
harder. These things seem to matter:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the further from Relica you are,</li>
<li>the further away you have been,</li>
<li>the more challenging the enemies you have ended,</li>
<li>the better equipped/longer you have been in game,</li>
<li>the more titles (achievments?) you have.</li>
<li>WHAT ELSE?</li>
</ul>

<p>
But unlike most games, FARA doesn't actually seem to be out to kill you as it
did in (what to me were) 'the nightmare versions' released some years ago.
</p>

<p>
Combat in FARA can be freaky cool, and as long as you prioritize survival over
your macho, you'll manage to escape and appreciate the insurance that having
even a single gulp of <a href="#org265a525">water</a> with you for that one time where its quicker to
drink and dash than it is to walk. But there's always <a href="#org43e6b8c">this</a>.

Small things on the ground can be seen up to 5 spaces away in a straight line,

<li>First, you can create one by dropping one of each elemental rune and making a spell. This still is very painful, but it won't destroy your stuff and doesn't require an inert rift shard.</li>
<li>Second, on one recent run I found a commoner with a quest to procure a "rift beacon." Turns out you build this using CRPs.</li>
<li>Apparently, they're able to summon Redeemed Rift Beasts which don't appear to be limited by the party size limit</li>
<li>Probably the stats of the Redeemed Rift beasts scale of distance away from relica</li>
<li>They seem to have a days survived stat that's always equal to yours, no matter when you summoned them.</li>
<li>I wonder where you could find the recipe for the RB</li>
<li>it's kind of busted for castle raiding</li>
<li>No idea. Might try feeding Relica's blacksmith until they hit on the recipe. That's how I got a gold ingot recipe.</li>

at least 2 fortresses.
</p>

<p>
When you come across a <b>Will of the Wild Fortress</b>, interact with the officer and
give them at least 10 medals. Interact with the Tactician and take the first 2
minor traits on the list.
</p>

<p>
Salvage all iron doors in every fortress you know of and hoard them on top of
your workbench. Continue doing easy quests until you have some copper or better
equipment, including a tower shield, and enough medals to make the total medals
given to Will of the Wild 100.
</p>

<p>
Go to the WotW Fortress with your medals and give them medals so you have max
rep with them in the /factions screen. This should take 100 total medals,
including the initial few you gave, though it will take more if you killed any
WotW staff.
</p>

<p>
Once you do that, take Analyzer (replacing the trait other than Plunderer) and
inspect all your copper (or better) equipment. You can now make iron versions of
that equipment. Do so.
</p>

<p>
How many runic shards do you have right now? Is it less than 266? /craft
dowel. /craft wooden shovel. /craft wooden repair kit. Find a beach. Dig (/dig)
once on each tile, picking up every rune that spawns. With a wooden shovel, you
can dig 16 times before you need to use your repair kit to fix your shovel. This
number will be lower if you use a non-wooden repair kit to repair the shovel.
</p>

<p>
If your shovel is orange, don’t dig again. If your wooden repair kit is broken,
find a pile of clay and /craft clay repair kit. A clay repair kit will give you
less digs per use, but is easy to produce.
</p>

<p>
Repeat this until you have enough runes to salvage to get you to 266 runic
shards, plus an additional Rune of Rejuvenation and Rune of Shields. Drop all
the other runes in your inventory and use the salvage all command (usually the 7
key, but may be a different key if you’re targeting something) until all the
runes are shards. Take those shards back home to your huge pile of stuff.
</p>

<p>
Make a Shield of Rejuvenation of a dual element of your choice (I recommend at
least using water in the shield, however) by dropping the Rune of Shields, the
Rune of Rejuvenation, and 2 elemental runes of your choice (and no other runes)
on the same tile, then doing /makespell. Learn this spell.
</p>

<p>
Go to the WotW Fortress and take the Fabricator trait, replacing Analyzer. Go
back home and craft 7 Reinforced Tools and 7 Artisan tools. Use the Reinforced
tools on your equipment, then go to the WotW Fortress once more and take the
Forgemaster trait.
</p>

<p>
Use your Artisan Tools on your equipment. Put water runes on three of your
equipment and 2 of everything else on your equipment, excluding your weapon. You
only put water on your weapon because it's healing every heavy attack. Putting
any extra runes on the weapon would cause the healing to be every other heavy
attack, effectively halving your healing.
</p>

<p>
Finally, craft enough Sturdy Plates to get you to Godlike RES and slap those on
pieces of your equipment that aren’t your weapon. Your weapon should have an
Arcane Sigil, which must be found (Tool Chests are useful for this.) The
remaining slots are your choice. FIN is useful for stealth, INS for lowering
your Ward’s cost, STR for getting it to godlike, and CHA for increasing your
Ward’s and Rejuvenation’s duration.
</p>

<p>
Congratulations, you’re pretty close to immortal. Remember to use your Ward of
Rejuvenation before starting a fight, rather than after, and to heavy attack
twice when you’re able in order to heal. If you’re low on health, enter a safe
location, use your Ward of Rejuvenation, and walk around until the rejuvenation
wears off, then cast it again. Repeat until full health.
</p>

<p>
The only things that can realistically threaten you are your own stupidity,
Ruins if you aren’t careful, and potentially some spoiler monster. Though, this
assumes you don’t walk too far from Relica. I haven’t seen what kind of damage
output exists thousands of km away from Relica.
</p>

<p>
So, go crazy (except around Ruins. Be careful there.) Kill whatever. You’ll get
significantly more points if you get key fragments, so go get them. Castles are
easy sources, since you can just kill all the guards in the noble’s room, then
kill the noble for a fragment, then stealth away.
</p>

<p>
Be sure to use any Obelisk Shards you get to upgrade your Shield of Rejuvenation
to Flawless.
</p>

<p>
Once you get the key, start eating fragments with /cast conversion. Only eat one
at a time, and only after you get your 10th fragment. This maximizes points per
fragment by making you get key completion points every time you get a
fragment. Using conversions on godlike stats is wasteful, but otherwise, use
them on whatever you want. It’s just a matter of time until you have 100k+
points.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-7-3-1-7">
<p>
Well met, travelers!
Public Alpha 16 is here, and with it come some HUGE changes to the core mechanics of FARA. Combat and dying have been overhauled, and many other facets have been adjusted with the goals of encouraging exploration and smoothing game progression. I want to give a special thanks to the volunteers in our awesome Discord community for testing these changes over the last month. FARA is so much better because of your thoughtful feedback and gigantic brains. The notes presented below are but a fraction of what this update has to offer. FARA is a game about exploration after all, so I encourage you to start a new adventure and discover all the new goodies for yourself!
</p>
</div>



<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org2516bc3"></a>BLIGHTS:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-1-7-1">
<p>
This update adds a little more flair to the concept of permadeath with the introduction of the Blight mechanic. Instead of immediately perishing when dealt a killing blow, you now have the option to be resurrected with a permanent difficulty modifier. These modifiers, or blights, range from stat reductions to increased encounter rate. You have the option to accept a blight every time you die, but the chances of successfully resurrecting are lowered based on the number of blights you have.
</p>

<p>
As FARA grows in scope and presents new long-term progression options for players, the idea of permadeath as it existed seemed harsh and out of place. With the blight system, players should feel more empowered to explore and grow with the same character without the threat of their first mistake completely wiping out all of the time and resources they've invested in their worlds.
</p>
</div>
</li>



<li><a id="org6d7b10d"></a>COMBAT:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-1-7-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Variable speeds for most combat actions have been removed, making combat feel more turn-based. For every action you perform, all other combatants will also perform a single action.</li>

<li>Added a /dash action. Dashing allows entities to move across multiple tiles in a single moment at the cost of stamina. Max dash distance is determined, among other factors, by Finesse. Dashing can also be performed by holding Shift and using the arrow keys. Releasing the Shift key will perform the dash.</li>

<li>Added ~10 new unique heavy attack effects, including unique effects for Insight-based weapons</li>

<li>Swapping two held items is now a free action which does not use a turn.</li>

<li>Weapon size no longer plays a role in damage output or speed.</li>

<li>Heavy attack stamina usage is now determined by the wielder's proficiency in the weapon's 'needed' stat.</li>

<li>Reduced the duration of most effects, buffs, and debuffs by ~75%. Because of the changes to action speed, effects still expire at roughly the same point in a combat encounter.</li>

<li>Most common damage-over-time effects now tick every moment instead of every ~5. Because of the duration reductions, they still deal about the same amount of total damage.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>



<li><a id="orgfe5399e"></a>EXPLORATION &amp; CRAFTING:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-1-7-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added some new items and NPCs in settlements to aid in resource management and exchanges</li>

<li>Removed hunger and thirst</li>

<li>Increased the likelihood of finding items and NPCs of interest when exploring local areas</li>

<li>Reduced encounter chance when moving on the world map</li>

<li>Common enemies now have a chance to drop crafting resources</li>

<li>Increased starting inventory size from 20 to 25</li>

<li>Increased Hidden Pocket inventory bonus from 2 to 5</li>

<li>Simplified the crafting requirements of many weapons and tools</li>

<li>Increased the material cost Workbenches and gave them the ability to repair all personal items at once</li>

<li>Removed a big chunk of the starting recipes and dramatically increased the likelihood of finding items/recipes you don't have</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>



<li><a id="org7de1fac"></a>CLASS CHANGES:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-1-7-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Illusionist: Removed Blink spell and replaced it with Prestige, an ability which allows the caster and target to switch places</li>

<li>Juggernaut: Their /dash causes damage to encountered obstacles</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>



<li><a id="org538231a"></a>NEW LAYOUT OPTIONS:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-1-7-5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added 2 new interface layout options which can be enabled with /layout2 (also known as /bigmap) and /layout3. They can be particularly helpful for those who wish the minimap was larger:</li>
</ul>

<p>
Layout 1 (default):
Layout2:
Layout 3:
</p>
</div>
</li>


<li><a id="org02992e6"></a>MISCELLANEOUS:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-1-7-6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Made some substantial engine optimizations. The game should run much, much better in crowded environments.</li>

<li>Mouseover tooltips can now be disabled with /tooltips.</li>

<li>Arcane Obelisks in settlements now have infinite uses.</li>

<li>Autoloot is now enabled by default. If you've played FARA before, you might need to manually turn this setting on with /autoloot, or via the /settings menu.</li>

<li>FINALLY updated some of the outdated information under /help and /define</li>

<li>Fixed a crash caused by butchering fish</li>

<li>Fixed an issue with blight spells (now called plagues) lasting forever</li>

<li>Fixed a crash caused by /define</li>

<li>Fixed all sorts of typos</li>

<li>Added new typos</li>
</ul>



<p>
As is the case with every update regardless of size, starting up a new adventure is strongly recommended over trying to load an older save. In this case, trying to load anything older than 0.0.16 won't even work.
</p>

<p>
Good luck out there, travelers!

<li><a id="org092c992"></a>2021.02.13 Patch Notes<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-7-3-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Removed several unfinished settlement facilities. They will make a return when they actually do something. For now, every settlement has the same 5 facilities, and they are always in the same style of building.</li>
<li>Finished the Warehouse facility</li>
<li>Added a /recipe 'itemname' command which lists the components of a specified known recipe. Can also be performed with /rcp.</li>
<li>Added a /deletetitle command for permanently removing earned titles from the /factions window</li>
<li>Added 'Repair' as a mouse menu option when possible</li>
<li>Updated castle Nobles to fall more in line with the quest behavior of settlement Elders. One notable difference is that the completion or failure of noble quests will affect faction reputation. For now, the quest types are the same ones you know and love, with the goal of having faction-specific quest types in the future.</li>
<li>Inspecting bags now unlocks recipes for the next size/type of bag.</li>
<li>The /repair command can now utilize Repair Kits on the ground as long as they're within reach.</li>
<li>Made unknown landmarks more obvious when traversing the world map</li>
<li>If you've been having input issues and have a game controller connected to your computer, you may now use /ignorecontrollers to (hopefully) fix any problems.</li>
<li>Typing '/inspect all' will now inspect all items on your target list. Each inspection still counts as a complete action, and the sequence will be interrupted if you take damage.</li>
<li>Updated the criteria for which character deaths/retirements are announced on Discord</li>
<li>The character sheet now properly shows attunements after death</li>
<li>Fixed a long-standing issue with NPCs taking 1 more moment than the player to perform any action. The fix for the this was suspiciously easy, so I'm positive I've broken something. Let me know what you find!</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented Traders from working as intended</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the /autosave setting from persisting after reload. Note, this is different from the forced saves that take place after certain game events. Forced saves cannot be disabled.</li>
<li>Fixed several instances of jank looking fireworks when /bigmap is enabled</li>
<li>Fixed several instances of map cursors lingering longer than they should</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which prevented the manifestation of a second minor trait if you had a major trait</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with cavern entities such as chests and nodes crowding the cavern entrance instead of being spread throughout the cavern.</li>
<li>Fixed a game crash caused by the Giant Swing ability</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with certain entities not showing up on the target list at the proper distances</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused several craftable items to be described as 'wood' when they weren't</li>
<li>So many optimizations</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-7-3-2-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Repair Kits are now stackable, single use, and have a different recipe.</li>
<li>Added a /repair command which will use a Repair Kit on a specified item</li>
<li>Arguments for the /targetfilter command can now be preceeded with a '-' to exclude certain results, i.e. '/targetfilter -tree' will filter out all trees from the target list.</li>
<li>Fixed some crashes related to items which are no longer available</li>
<li>Fixed NPC Politicians not being able to use their ability</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-7-3-2-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added a /bigmap layout, which shifts some interface elements around to accommodate a much larger, centralized mini(?)map. Enabling this layout will also trigger some other interface changes which can be controlled individually:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>/reverselog which switches the direction and order of game log messages. The most recent event will be at the top.</li>
<li>/objectivewindow which is a new window in the upper left for tracking active quests</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Adjusted Plague Doctor: The negative conditions they spread now affect targets for twice the duration of the original effect</li>
<li>Replaced several chest types with more generous versions</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-7-3-2-31">
<p>
Long time no see, travelers!
</p>

<p>
It's been 568 days since FARA's last public update, but that isn't to say the project has been dormant. A dedicated, intrepid group of adventurers has been testing a rebuilt version of the game since July, and that test-of-a-test is now ready for everyone to&#x2026; test. There have been well over 120 patches in that time, and what's listed below is a summary of the highlights. If by chance you want to read every raw, potentially spoilery, nitty gritty detail without much context, you can find the full 1,300+ line changelog here: <a href="http://playfara.com/2020changelog.txt">http://playfara.com/2020changelog.txt</a>. I want to give my most heartfelt thanks to everyone invited to test the changes over the last few months. You could have spent that time and energy on anything, and the fact you chose to help make FARA a better game means the world to me.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="orgcd63105"></a>SUMMARY:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-2-31-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The biggest goal of this update was to re-write many of FARA's underlying systems and data structures. In doing so, the game should run faster and scale better with future development. There are also a TON of bug fixes, gameplay changes, and usability improvements. If you've tried FARA in the past and spent more time fighting the interface than monsters, I encourage you to give this new build a shot.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org8a309b9"></a>INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-2-31-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can now hold down the arrow keys to continuously move in a direction. Additionally, you can click and drag from the center of the screen to activate a virtual joystick and move around.</li>

<li>There is now an interact button in the target window which can either be clicked to perform the displayed action, or at least inform you of what action pressing [ Enter ] will perform.</li>

<li>Right-clicking in the center of the screen now presents the same target options as clicking on the target window. Holding the right mouse button down while scrolling the mouse wheel will cycle through targets.</li>

<li>Hovering the mouse over objects on the map will display what they are, and clicking an object will target it and bring up a list of options.</li>

<li>Added more bump-to-interact options. Bumping into foliage will harvest it, bumping into large ore nodes will attempt to mine them, bumping into non-hostile NPCs will /interact with them.</li>

<li>Added drag and drop! Dragging objects from the Nearby Targets window and dropping them on your inventory or the game log will attempt to /take them. Dragging items in your possession and releasing them on the game log will /drop them. Dragging items in your possession and releasing them on your target will attempt to /give the item. You can also drag items between your holding, wearing, and inventory windows.</li>

<li>Added tooltips! You can now hover your cursor over most objects and targets to learn about them.</li>

<li>Added animations! Several (mostly combat-related) actions now have animated effects which will play over the target window or the center of the screen.</li>

<li>Added a new interface for building structures. Press [ b ] or type /build with Wooden Blocks near by to create buildings one room at a time instead of tile by tile.</li>

<li>The health and stamina bars are now displayed by default.</li>

<li>All of the most frequently used pop-up windows (/character, /spells, /recipes, etc) now have tabs along the top, allowing quick access to the other frequently viewed windows. Continuously pressing [ c ] will cycle through all of the windows.</li>

<li>Clicking on party members now displays options to view their stats, items, and spells.</li>

<li>Pressing [ - ] now opens a window which shows the entire local map. If you are in a dungeon or somewhere similar, this map will only show areas you have seen. This feature can also be accessed by clicking the header of the minimap or typing /map.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org26bde4f"></a>GAMEPLAY CHANGES:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-2-31-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There is now a static settlement named Relica near the start of an adventure. The further you travel from Relica, the more difficult (and rewarding) the game becomes. There are still randomly generated settlements, but they are few and far between.</li>

<li>Added fast travel, accessed by either clicking a waypoint or typing /travel (waypoint number). If you are tracking a waypoint, you can also click on the compass.</li>

<li>Most randomness has been removed from combat. There are no longer chances to miss or crit - both will happen consistently when the right conditions are met. Elemental weapons will always trigger their effects with heavy attacks and never on regular attacks. Elemental spells will always trigger their effects with every cast.</li>

<li>Jumping while targeted by an attack will cause you to dodge the attack. In the case of a spell, you will take half the spell's normal damage and avoid any secondary effects.</li>

<li>Ranged weapon attacks now has a reload penalty which adds time to your next action</li>

<li>Stamina now regenerates over time, and is more of a per-encounter resource than a per-rest resource. Heavy attacks and jumping/dodging use considerably more stamina than before.</li>

<li>The gap between the lowest and highest health classes has been narrowed. Classes now either have slightly below average health, average, or slightly about average health.</li>

<li>Most of the primary stats have been renamed, and their purposes tweaked:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Strength: Increases damage dealt with melee weapons and unarmed strikes, decreases stamina spent pushing large objects</li>
<li>Finesse: Increases damage dealt with ranged weapons, increases chance to disarm traps, increases stealth ability, decreases reload time of ranged weapons, decreases stamina use of jumping and stealth</li>
<li>Resilience: Reduces physical damage taken, reduces duration of negative effects, increases stamina regeneration rate</li>
<li>Insight: Increases damage of spells, increases search ability, decreases stamina cost of spells</li>
<li>Charm: Increases the duration of positive effects, increases odds of favorable outcomes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wisdom has been removed</li>

<li>Added equipment slots - Head, Body, Hands, Feet, and Accessory. Typical equipment will fit into one of the slots. The accessory slot retains the old behavior of allowing anything* to be equipped there.</li>

<li>Added a trait system. Traits add passive bonuses and features to your character. There are 3 types - Master, Major, and Minor. Master traits are determined by your class and cannot be changed. Major and Minor traits can be acquired from different factions as rewards for helping them. You can have 1 Major trait and 2 Minor traits.</li>

<li>Added several new enemies, encounter types and scenarios</li>

<li>Dungeons have been reworked to produce more interesting layouts, and new kinds of obstacles have been added</li>

<li>Randomly generated factions have been removed in favor of 3 static factions - the Radiant Hand, the Jade Circle, and the Wild of the Wild. There is a lot in store for the faction system, but for now, they serve as the primary means of acquiring traits.</li>

<li>World biome distribution is far more logical and aesthetically pleasing than before.</li>

<li>Meals are now stackable, provide rejuvenation, and only use a single ingredient. Cooking multiple items on a fire will produce multiple meals.</li>

<li>Crafting materials have been rebalanced across the board. A handful have been removed, and several new ones have been added.</li>

<li>You can no longer craft unknown objects for twice the material cost. Instead, inspecting an item will teach several related recipes.</li>

<li>The default maximum party size has been reduced from 4 to 2.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orgedf340e"></a>CLASS CHANGES:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-2-31-4">
<p>

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>Adventurer has been reworked: "Adventurers have an increased chance to find rare items. They also have the Heroic Feat ability which provides a temporary boost to all stats once per rest."</li>

<li>Fishmonger has been reworked: "Fishmongers cannot drown, take greatly reduced damage while Intoxicated and are immune to the negative effects, and have a higher chance to catch rare items while fishing."</li>

<li>Elemancer has been reworked: "Elemancers have a bonus to all elemental attunements. They also have the Attune ability which channels the elemental energy of a target to boost the caster's relative attunement. Successfully casting the ability a second time will combine the elements, providing two boosts at half the potency. Attunements are lost after rest."</li>

<li>Scholar has been reworked: "Scholars gain Enlightenment after conversing with someone or learning a new recipe, temporarily increasing their insight. Scholars can cast spells from scrolls at higher tiers based on their insight, and can use the same scroll several times."</li>

<li>Gamber has been reworked: "Gamblers have access to the 'Gamble' ability which inflicts a random negative condition to either the caster or their target. Charm reduces the stamina cost of this ability and increases the likelihood of afflicting the target over the caster. When used on certain chests, Gamble will either upgrade the quality of the chest or completely destroy it."</li>

<li>Ragamuffin has been reworked: "Ragamuffins have an increased chance to steal successfully, and can find a wider variety of items. In combat, Ragamuffins can attempt to /steal weapons used to attack them."</li>

<li>Wrestler has been reworked: "Wrestlers can use the Giant Swing ability, allowing them to throw a target to an area of their choosing, causing them to take damage, land prone, and become Dazed. Additionally, Wrestlers are immune to being dazed, and do not receive any penalties while prone."</li>

<li>Bodybuilders have been reworked: "Bodybuilders have access to the Flex ability which will blind a hostile target. If completely unarmored, Flex will also provide a temporary Charm bonus and cleanse negative status effects."</li>

<li>Kensai has been tweaked: In addition to their Samurai Showdown ability, they now instantly counter-attack after performing a perfect dodge.</li>

<li>Illusionist has been reworked: "Illusionists will immediately enter stealth for a short duration when damaged by a critical hit. Additionally, Illusionists detect illusions and disguises without fail."</li>

<li>Rift Dancer has been reworked: "A Rift Dancer's heavy attacks and spells summon creatures from other planes."</li>
</ul>

<p>
Saying there is more to the update than what is listed above would be the understatement of a lifetime. While I could have gone into greater detail, let's not forget that FARA is a game about exploration and discovery. Adventure awaits!

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-7-3-4-2">
<p>
The first public alpha for FARA was released one year ago today! I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who's taken the time to try FARA out and provide feedback. This game wouldn't be even half of what it is today were it not for the enthusiastic, welcoming, and dedicated community which has built up over the last year. I've wanted to be a game dev since I was a kid, and the FARA community has made that dream more fulfilling than I ever thought possible. You all have been incredible, and I look forward to the continued discourse that has shaped the game into something so many people find enjoyable. Now, let's celebrate the occasion by making the game way harder:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Key Fragments no longer resurrect the player when killed.</li>
<li>Added a new innate spell to the player character - Astral Blessing. This ability expends ALL collected Key Fragments to completely restore health, stamina, and mood. Astral Blessing also bestows several positive effects for a moderate duration, removes all hunger and thirst, and damages nearby enemies.</li>
<li>Started working on some public leaderboard stuff. When a character of notable achievement dies, retires, slays a dungeon boss, or completes the Astral Key, an announcement will be made in the FARA Discord (<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn">https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn</a>). You can set a username ingame with /setusername yourname. You can opt out of this feature with /eventsharing.</li>
<li>Increased the importance of dexterity for reliably hitting targets with ranged weapons</li>
<li>Removed the strength bonus from ranged weapon damage</li>
<li>Made some changes to the start of the game</li>
<li>Removed wooden planks from the game and adjusted crafting recipes for objects which used them</li>
<li>Individual keybindings can now be reset with '/setkey keytochange default'</li>
<li>Made an adjustment which should make it a little easier to build shelters when you have allies following you</li>
<li>Typing /define without specifying any text wil now show all glossary entries.</li>
<li>Non-sentient entities can no longer be knocked prone.</li>
<li>Fixed several broken commands issued via mouse menu</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which prevented the [ z ] key from being re-bound</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which allowed certain monster abilities to work on slain entities</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that allowed traps be salvaged with /salvageall.</li>
<li>Fixed (more) issues with the Pounce ability</li>
<li>Fixed an edge case with Elder riddles which allowed duplicates of certain answers</li>
<li>Fixed a crash caused by entering castles</li>
</ul>

<p>
A fresh game is required in order to continue regular play.

<li>Dead entities can no longer be given things</li>
<li>Adjusted generated monster descriptions to hopefully reduce confusion about the size of any given beast</li>

<li><a id="org79d88d6"></a>2019.05.11 Patch Notes<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-7-3-4-8">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added a new class, the Bloodweaver! Unique Ability: Hemophiliancy - Bloodweavers have access to the Blood Pact spell which places a Sigil of Blood on a target. This sigil slowly grows in potency over time, dealing increased damage while increasing the power of the target. Casting Blood Pact on a target affected by Sigil of Blood will transfer the sigil to the caster while retaining its potency level. Casting Blood Pact on target while affected by Sigil of Blood will transfer the existing sigil to the target. Only one Sigil of Blood may be active at a time.</li>
<li>Reworked Beekeeper. Unique Ability: Hiveminded - When Beekeepers interact with beehives, they become swarmed by a mass of bees which they can command using the Send Bees and Call Bees abilities. Beehives of different materials produce different kinds of swarms. Beekeepers have no additional materials cost for building unknown hive types, and are immune to the negative effects of swarms.</li>
<li>Made some adjustments to the Elemancer class:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reduced health to Below Average</li>
<li>The trigger chance for elements on their armor is now based on the quality of the armor</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Reduced the material cost of shelters</li>

<li>Travelling unstealthed in the overworld no longer uses stamina. Traveling stealthed uses stamina and takes twice as long.</li>
<li>Increased the rate at which hunger and thirst build while travelling the overworld</li>
<li>Reworked animal mounting. Potential mounts must now be tamed with a saddle before they can be ridden. The quality of the saddle as well as several other factors determine the likelihood of successfully taming an animal. Equestrians get a bonus to tame attempts.- Entities now also have a chance to be knocked from their mount when struck.</li>
<li>Entities can no longer trigger elemental effects via self-targeted skills and abilities.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the Quests &amp; Reputation menu option from displaying correctly</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused the bleeding effects caused by Pit Fighters to last longer than intended</li>

<p>
This build contains critical bug fixes, and updating is strongly recommended.

<li><a id="org195881f"></a>2019.05.01 Public Alpha 14 is LIVE - Perfectly balanced*, as all things should be.<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-7-3-4-15">
<p>
NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 14:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All items and materials have had their stats rebalanced, and 4 new materials have been added. Generally speaking, achieving extremely high stats takes more planning than before, and fights should last a little longer with (slightly) fewer unexpected damage spikes.</li>
<li>The dexterity stat has been completely reworked, and with it comes a few changes to combat:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The dodge chance provided by dexterity now only applies when moving or jumping. This means that in order to be successful with a dexterous character, you actually need to move around as you fight.</li>
<li>Dexterity now reduces the stamina cost of jumping, and the cost of jumping has been slightly increased.</li>
<li>High dexterity is now critical for reliably disarming traps and using stealth</li>
<li>The "enemy blocked your movement even though you weren't going that way" mechanic has been removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Charisma now increases the duration of positive effects in addition to reducing the duration of negative ones.</li>
<li>Intelligence now reduces the cost of most spells instead of Wisdom</li>
<li>Constitution and Wisdom are now more effective at reducing physical and elemental damage respectively.</li>
<li>Added a new item type: Reinforcements. Reinforcements can be added to other items to increase certain stats or grant advantages to certain actions.</li>
<li>Added a message grouping setting which consolidates repeated messages into a single line. It is on by default, and can be toggled with /messagegrouping.</li>
<li>Added speed information to attack messages</li>
<li>Added [ ? ] as a hard-coded shortcut to open /help</li>
<li>Added several new encounter types and revamped the Caravan encounter</li>
<li>Added 2 new weapon types</li>
<li>Revamped the /inventory command to show a detailed list of all your possessions. The default shortcut is [ shift + i ].</li>
<li>Reworked the /accomplishments screen to provide a little more detail about your deeds, and expanded it beyond quest completions. Entries will also be generated for title acquisitions, defeating legendary beasts, etc.</li>
<li>Pigments and Scribe Chests have been removed from the game, and instead areas can be marked freely with the new /mark (color) command. Areas can be cleaned with /clearmark.</li>
<li>Fleshed out the noise system a bit. If something is moving nearby and you can't see it, you might still hear it.</li>
<li>Allies can now be instructed to ride animals</li>
<li>The darkness effect now increases the mood of the attacker in addition to draining the mood of the target</li>
<li>Increased the amount of stamina gained from the Soul effect</li>
<li>Players can now choose their class with the mouse during character creation.</li>
<li>Reduced overworld encounter chance slightly</li>
<li>Reduced the base duration of Elemental summons</li>
<li>Reduced damage taken by armor and added variance based on the type of attack used against it.</li>
<li>Fleeing local areas now restores health and stamina to any hostile pursuers.</li>
<li>Crafting Repair Kits now makes five at a time, and Repair Kits now only work on items of the same material</li>
<li>Active traps must now be disabled before they can be salvaged.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused innate spells to cost less stamina than intended</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which could prevent spells from having reduced stamina costs</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented mouse menus from working if Quick Actions were disabled</li>
<li>Fixed a crash caused by bags</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where players could get trapped in Legendary Beast dens</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which allowed the /connect command to be used on anything</li>
<li>Updated several /help and /define entries</li>
</ul>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="orgdac5388"></a>CLASS CHANGES:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-4-15-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Pit Fighter: When critically hit, Pit Fighters gain the Payback effect, which grants bonus damage to their next attack based on the amount of damage received.</li>
<li>Gamestalker: Gamestalkers now deal more damage the farther away their target is, and their accuracy trait has been removed</li>
<li>Juggernaut: The knockdown effect of the Juggernaut's movement now interrupts the actions of those affected.</li>

<li><a id="org7377919"></a>HIGHLIGHTS SINCE PUBLIC ALPHA 0.0.13.0:<br />

<li>Cannons now deal splash damage to objects adjacent to the target</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added two new quest types</li>
<li>Reworked Kensai. Unique Ability: Samurai Showdown - Kensais have access to the Samurai Showdown ability which dashes to a targeted area at imperceivable speeds. Enemies along the path receive the [Already Dead] effect which deals damage after a brief delay and grants fury to the Kensai. The damage and fury duration are determined by the number of enemies hit.</li>
<li>You can now tell party members to be/not be passive. While passive, party members will still defend themselves and their allies, but will not immediately attack anything you attack.</li>
<li>Added several more /say commands for managing same-species party members including:

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
As is usually required when there's a big update**,
a fresh game is required for everything to work properly,
and the game probably won't start at all if you attempt to load an older save.

<li><a id="org57bd502"></a>2019.04.01 Public Alpha 13 is LIVE - Combat: Evolved<br />
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org20c9025"></a>NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 13:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-5-5-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This alpha release overhauls FARA's oldest, and quite frankly, most confusing system - combat:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Offensive attacks, defensive attacks, evasive attacks, balanced attacks, pushing, kicking, and parries have been removed in favor of just two attacks: Regular attacks ([ a ] or /attack) and Heavy attacks ([ shift + a ] or /attackheavy).</li>
<li>Regular attacks behave mostly like Balanced attacks from pre Alpha 13.</li>
<li>Heavy attacks tend to be slower, more powerful, use stamina, decrease weapon durability, and trigger special effects based on the weapon used. For instance, performing a heavy attack with a dagger or similar small blade will cause the attacker to leap backward evasively after the strike. Other heavy attacks can deflect projectiles, apply status effects, etc.</li>
<li>Entities gain most of the benefits provided by the removed Defensive/Evasive stances as long as they can see the attacker and are not performing any actions (including attacking)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added class-specific combat behaviors for NPCs. Gunslingers will jumping around to dodge ranged attacks, Alchemists will throw mixtures, etc.</li>
<li>Added ~10 new weapon types</li>
<li>Rebalanced the stats for several material and item types</li>
<li>Entities no longer need a target selected to attack. Attacking without a target will now just attack in the direction you are facing.</li>
<li>Made several changes to the stealth mechanic to award those who properly prepare for the occasion</li>
<li>Elemental Resistance has been changed to Elemental Attunement.  In addition to granting resistances, attunement also increases the potency of one's triggered elemental effects</li>
<li>Health and stamina bars now show the last instance of damage in a slightly faded color</li>
<li>Increased inventory capacity from 20 to 25</li>
<li>Reduced the damage of most melee weapons</li>
<li>Combative NPCs will now investigate strange noises they hear from unseen entities</li>
<li>Changed the Intoxicated condition - it now reduces attack accuracy while increasing charisma, constitution, and the chance to stumble after missing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orga22f55e"></a>CLASS CHANGES:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-5-5-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Gatekeeper - Reworked their unique ability: "Gatekeepers have a higher than usual chance to deflect projectiles and block moving enemies attempting to flee. Additionally, their shields and armor take less damage when struck."</li>
<li>Elemancer - They now received a bonus to all elemental attunements</li>
<li>Dervish - Whirling now prevents Dervishes from being interrupted by attacks</li>
<li>Rhapsodist - Their songs now require four notes and are a combination of heavy and regular attacks</li>
<li>Monk - Path of Fire now triggers for entities in tiles adjacent to the jump path</li>

<li><a id="orgbfec851"></a>2019.03.02 Public Alpha 12 is LIVE - Mouse/Touch Support!<br />
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org5d082fc"></a>NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 12:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-6-8-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This alpha release introduces a pretty big game-changer regarding accessibility - FARA can now enjoyed with a mouse or touchscreen! As much as I love writing beefy changelogs, the changes are pretty simple:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Clicking/tapping objects on the side panels will display a tiny* menu with various contextual actions</li>
<li>Clicking anywhere in the central game log or status section will provide access to more general commands and features</li>
<li>Clicking on a map tile will now move your character toward that tile. If you're in a local area, you'll zip right to the targeted location in one click. If you're on the world map, you'll move one tile in the direction of the cursor. Clicking the center tile will search the area.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org7c4d3ed"></a>QUALITY OF LIFE AND OTHER CHANGES:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-6-8-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rebalanced health values across all classes. If your favorite class went from 'Above Average' to 'Average' health, it doesn't necessarily mean the value is lower than before. Additionally, the classifications of health no longer vary between classes. Two classes with 'Above Average' health now have exactly the same amount.</li>
<li>Pressing the [ enter ] key will now trigger the /interact function with your target if the command prompt is closed.</li>
<li>Dramatically improved the pathfinding capabilities of NPCs.</li>
<li>Added richer descriptions and additional mouse menu options for those interested in playing with the UI disabled</li>
<li>Added /moveto command which pathfinds your way to a target</li>
<li>/takeall no longer picks up Supply Crates and Barrels</li>
<li>/salvage and /salvageall will now open all nearby Supply Crates and Barrels</li>
<li>Tweaked some things to make the game less frustrating for players who (for whatever reason) want to play the game on mobile devices. FARA still isn't exactly mobile-friendly and I still wouldn't recommend playing it on a phone if you can help it, but this patch should make such a thing far more possible, particularly on Android devices running Chrome.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the dexterity score of certain animals and monsters from being properly applied</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause cooking from the Quick Actions menu to cook the wrong item</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to destroying boulders</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause party members to rob you in your sleep. May re-add.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with climbing that allowed entities to remain elevated even if the climbed item was destroyed</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused commoners to suggest visiting the town you're already in</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause colosseum Champions to leave a life of glory behind in favor of murdering you in your sleep for no reason in particular</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that allowed abused Combat Dummies to cast aside their shackles and hunt down their oppressors</li>
</ul>

<li>More descriptive combat logs</li>
<li>Quests from Bounty Boards no longer disappear when accepted and can be abandoned and tracked again later.</li>
<li>Dramatically increased the performance of map animations with minimal* downsides</li>
<li>Butchering a salvaging now teach you about the objects/animals before dismantling them</li>
<li>Added an /exit command which will return the player to the world map from a local area. It can also be done with /leave.</li>
<li>Expanded the functionality of /interact</li>
<li>Added some friendly fire protection. Attacking a healthy party member once will no longer cause them to turn on you. Attacking them a second time within a certain time frame or while they are Injured or Dying will cause them to retaliate.</li>
<li>Overhauled the movement speed system and made the stat visible in the /character window</li>

As a friendly reminder, you can quickly exit local areas and settlements by typing /exit.</li>

<li>Started re-implementing town expansion.

the empty dirt plots as you complete quests.  Any entities on these plots when
the building spawns will be moved elsewhere or vaporized if there is nowhere
else for them to go.</li>

log.</li>

<li><a id="orgeb9bb53"></a>NEW IN PUBLIC ALPHA 11:<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-7-3-7-10-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Combat and object interactions have been removed from the overworld.
</p>

<p>
Most of the game now takes place at the zoom level once reserved for indoor
spaces and dungeons. While viewing the overworld map, press [ Enter ], [ e ],
or type /explore to drop down to the local level.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As you travel, you will happen upon encounters which automatically trigger
the local view. Having most the game take place at the local level offers
many new and exciting perks:</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Bump to attack!
Under most circumstances, living entities can no longer share the same map
tile. Among other things, this means you can now attack hostile targets by
simply walking into them.</li>

<li>Ranged weaponry in general is now much more viable.</li>

<li>Most interactions that required entities to be on the same tile can now
happen from 1 tile away.</li>

<li>The open spaces allow for more tactical combat. You can utilize terrain
features for cover, stand against large objects to avoid being surrounded, or
climb trees to get a better vantage.</li>

<li>NPC path-finding has been beefed up so they aren't so easily bested by trees
and building corners.</li>

<li>Area of effect spells have been reworked to take advantage of multiple tiles</li>

<li>The jumping mechanic has been reworked, and is now an indispensable tool
when dealing with attackers at range.</li>

<li>Settlements and encampments are now truly explorable areas.</li>

<li>Buildings as items have been removed, and instead players can craft walls and
floor tiles. Using these, you can create any building size and shape you want!</li>

<li>Rivers and ponds are no longer targetable objects, and are instead features
of the landscape you can walk up to and utilize.</li>

<li>Several classes have been tweaked to take advantage of the new mechanics and
space.</li>

<li>Added several new map effects to basic combat</li>

<li>Added pigments! Pigments allow you mark an area with a specific color, and can
be combined to produce every color under the rainbow.</li>

<li>Added a little color variety to the target dots on the map</li>

<li>Added party member items to the /compare window</li>

<li>Reworked the robbery mechanic to be a bit more engaging and straightforward</li>

<li>ADDED THE ABILITY TO PET ANIMALS</li>
</ul>

<p>
Getting all of the old systems up to speed is an ongoing effort, so expect a few
more related patches next week that address new issues like movement speed.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-7-3-8-2">
<p>
This is far and away the biggest update FARA has received since its public
release in May 2018, and I'd love your feedback. If you haven't already, please
consider joining us on Discord! <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn">https://discordapp.com/invite/TxECEtn</a>
</p>

<p>
Finally, I want to give a BIG shout out to everyone in the FARA Discord who
helped test earlier versions of this release over the past two weeks. They
suffered tremendously so that you might suffer slightly less. These expansive
changes might have never seen the light of day were it not for their positive
feedback and encouragement, so thanks for taking the time to provide some top
notch insights. There is still plenty of in-game text that needs updating and
bugs that need squashing, so if you come across something that doesn't seem
quite right, be sure to let me know!

<p>
you likely wont be able to run the game from your file-manager since FARA is technically
a shared library, so, from the shell type <b>./FARA</b> to get it going from its dir.
</p>

<p>
if you want a thing to right-click to start the game, issue:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>save-games go into <b>~/.config/FARA</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
that's chrome's doing and because the save-files are pretty large consider
symlinking that path to a place thats backed-up once a day, not hourly.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
the game plays well under X
</p>

<p>
and since the only time it really needs the disk is
 for saving, you can run it from a NAS or server without troubles.
</p>

<p>
/uianimation and screen-shaking should be disabled under X
</p></li>

<li>the actual thing you would appear to need to update between versions,
as long as the runtime does not change is 'resources/app.asar'.
its amazing that its just 2.8mb.</li>

Pug's experiments suggest:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>FARA needs at least three concurrent threads to be performant
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Anything better than a Dual-core CPU will do!
With a Dual-core you'll see the game slow to ~half speed after ~24hrs play.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2.2+ GHZ will be tolerable through a long game.</li>
<li>4ish GB RAM for Chrome/Electron/FARA (at most! usuall much less, no problem.)</li>
<li>Disk seems not important.</li>
</ul>

<p>
What's optimal? Anything Quad-core with DDR-4 RAM but DDR-3 will do.
The real key to good performance appears to be the size of your <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-cpu-cache/">CPU cache</a>.

I play on an upright external monitor. Since changes to /bigmap make it scale
with the height of the window FARA runs in without considering the width, I
need to change the FARA window size to make the most of /bigmap.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-7-2">
<p>
While not an open source application per se, with an <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> application such
as FARA one can <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/219">always</a> count on having <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/javascript-compilation-epoch-ebfb7b5bb664">access</a> to the code for personal use even
though one is dealing with an 'All rights reserved' kind of license.
</p>

<p>
Much like with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Flash</a>, you can easily <a href="https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=app.asar">unpack</a> the program, change the fonts and
user interface to please you without any loss in performance. Additionally with
a little <a href="https://www.thaoh.net/prettyjs/">extra</a> <a href="https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/">effort</a> you can learn to appreciate Brian's work a whole lot more
by taking a look at what's being shipped.
</p>

<p>
Obfuscated and linearized as the code is, you can't expect to do much but make
whatever crashes between minor release go away, but since you can do these
things inside an hour or less, learning a little bit about the way modern
software ticks and how it is shipped will let you glide past the otherwise
game-ending troubles that sometimes slip in between major release.
</p>


<p>
In this sense, and within these limits I can tolerate dealing with software that
isn't really free and open. Besides, there's no game like <a href="https://www.startpage.com/sp/search?query=developing+electron+apps+jetbrains">learning</a> by doing
</p>

<p>
This will make more sense to you once you've had your system and your data
destroyed and obsoleted by proprietary code a few times. Then you too might
appreciate the importance of free and open software and see the value of
acquiring some of the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">basic technical skills</a> hinted at here.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, if you want to mess with things, make sure to use <b>/stopreports</b>!  And
do yourself a favor, never use this approach to cheat or learn game secrets or
you will ruin your own fun. Let playing continue to be an enjoyable sandbox!
